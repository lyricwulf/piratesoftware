But… Right now it really does feel like that’s what I am: a victim. I truly wish I was never a part of this.\n\nI have never, ever wanted to blame that situation for how my life turned out… I never wanted to think anything like that, because I want to believe that I am in control of my own life. But… I also can’t deny the facts.\n\n\nCareer\n\nI was in college during these events, completing my undergrad requirements and double majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering.\n\nHere are transcripts from the semesters before the events happened. I maintained a GPA of 3.92 / 4. I received the Dean’s List and President’s Honor Roll accolades every semester.\n\n[/aftermath/effects-on-my-life/transcript-1.png]\n[/aftermath/effects-on-my-life/transcript-1.png]\n[/aftermath/effects-on-my-life/transcript-2.png]\n[/aftermath/effects-on-my-life/transcript-2.png]\n\nAfter the events mid-Fall 2018, my academic performance plummeted. I finished the Fall 2018 semester with a 2.76 GPA and was stripped of my honors accolades. The following semester I finished with a 2.57 GPA.\n\n[/aftermath/effects-on-my-life/transcript-3.png]\n[/aftermath/effects-on-my-life/transcript-3.png]\n[/aftermath/effects-on-my-life/transcript-4.png]\n[/aftermath/effects-on-my-life/transcript-4.png]\n\nAfter that semester, I dropped out of college.\n\nGrowing up I was always the gifted kid, the one with a bright future. I was able to maintain a 3.9 GPA, taking every summer semester too, all while maintaining my content creation.\n\nI didn’t think it affected me then… I always thought it was my own decision. I believed that I dropped out because I just couldn’t handle the pressure, that a life where I make the next big thing to improve humanity was just never in reach for me to begin with.\n\nI thought I just wasn’t smart enough.\n\nAfter reviewing my transcripts I can see they tell a different story entirely.\n\n\nYouTube\n\nHere is a table of my video and live stream counts (from here just called Posts).\n\n2016 173 Posts2017 156 Posts2018 162 Posts2019 99 Posts2020 26 Posts2021 1 Post2022 1 Post2023 0 Posts2024 0 Posts\n\nIn June 2019, I dropped out of college. I had much more time to work on creating content. Yet, my productivity plummeted. In April 2019, when I tried to speak out, Thor turned everyone against me. He destroyed my perception of the online community after his lies were taken as truth.\n\nLike academics, I always thought I stopped being motivated to make content because that life just wasn’t meant for me. I thought I was creatively burned out. I felt like I had peaked, that I already created everything good that I will ever make.\n\nI thought I just wasn’t creative enough.\n\n\n\n    \n 1. Career\n 2.

I believe that Thor and Shaye just wanted to make sure that the perception of their side of the story was entirely unquestionable, to get as many people on their side as possible.\n\nI believe that if I tried to reply to this at the time that I would have just been accused of falsifying emails.\n\nDonation Refund.eml ->\n/aftermath/lyrics-chargeback/Donation Refund.eml\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nPublic References\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/PirateSoftware/status/1114240256042098688\">https://x.com/PirateSoftware/status/1114240256042098688</a> replying to a <a>now deleted</a> post [/aftermath/lyrics-chargeback/tweet.png]\nhttps://x.com/PirateSoftware/status/1114240256042098688 [https://x.com/PirateSoftware/status/1114240256042098688] replying to a now deleted post\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/PirateSoftware/status/1114240256042098688\">https://x.com/PirateSoftware/status/1114240256042098688</a> replying to a <a>now deleted</a> post [/aftermath/lyrics-chargeback/tweet.png]\n\n\nTimeline of Transactions\n\n08/26/2018\n\n\n\n\nDonation\n\nLyric made a donation of $800 USD to gopiratesoftware through a donation link listed on their Twitch channel.

At this time, I do not have a copy of the original document, but we see portions of the contents in the comments.\n\nOriginal URL for “A Great Heartbound Adventure”: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15y13DTvLW1tgvc2lziMyTtZCLksr4HMBd1pVR5KgY_8/view [https://docs.google.com/document/d/15y13DTvLW1tgvc2lziMyTtZCLksr4HMBd1pVR5KgY_8/view]\n\n\nAnalyzing the Doc\n\nThe public comments reveal two statements that I made in the original document:\n\n> The reason that Thor and I currently have an issue with each other is due to our interaction at TwitchCon… Leading up to this encounter, Thor and I shared many intimate relations through our Telegram chat.\n\nIt is apparent to me now that I focused on the wrong details. At the time, I was hurt and wasn’t emotionally mature enough to fully comprehend why, let alone put it into words. I realize now that the emotional manipulation I experienced was far more important to share, yet I focused the details about his wife and about Shaye which were only at the forefront of my mind since that is when I felt that I was hurt. Due to that hurt, I didn’t read the chat logs, and I published them in an attempt to explain what made me feel the way I did.\n\nLooking back, the most important details are the interactions before TwitchCon, how my vulnerabilities were exploited by someone much older, and how I was manipulated to devote myself entirely to Thor. All of that important information was reduced simply to the statement “Thor and I shared many intimate relations through our Telegram chat”.\n\n\nFeedback\n\nThe initial feedback I received after publishing the doc was almost entirely trolling.\n\nAt the time, I believed leaving the document open to public comments would help gauge what parts were unclear and refine the document over time. However, I understand now that was not a good approach for multiple reasons:\n\n * It nearly guarantees that the initial document will not be in a ready state, since there is less incentive for me to refine the document before publication.\n * There will necessarily be more low-quality feedback than high-quality. The reasoning behind this is twofold:\n   * There are few people that have the time to both read the document and formulate feedback.\n   * A public forum does not put us on equal footing, considering the imbalance of community activity due to his large following. It is a lose-lose situation for fans to actually read the document, since they have to spend the time and energy to read it. There will necessarily be more people interested in defending him by any means than those who want to engage in reading a document which defames their idol.\n * It is not respectful of people’s time. It is not your job as the reader to proofread my document to suggest improvements. Rather, it is my job to ensure that I am communicating everything effectively, especially when I am making accusations against another person.\n\n\nAddressing Feedback\n\nI would like to address the only constructive comment I was able to find.\n\n> Apr 5, 2019, 1:16 PM\n> Anonymous comment: “the images in the “export” were last edited in 2018 tou FUCKING LIAR”\n\nThe export uses Telegram’s “Export chat history” feature.\nAll of the files are generated at the time of export, including copies of all stickers, media, and files, so the Creation Date and Last Modified Date will both reflect the time of export.\n\nAdditionally, the entire archive does take place in 2018, between the months of August and October.\n\n\nAll feedback received\n\nAfter I published the document, Thor’s community flooded the comments.

While it tends to be broadly accepted that YouTubers make money off of videos, I turned off monetization on my videos related to Heartbound, by his own request.\n\n\nVideos Not Monetized\n\nThor reached out to me about 24 hours after I published my first Heartbound video.\n\nGreat cover but unfortunately you monetized the video which is against our content guidelines.

The statements below are Thor’s claims, which can be deduced because they are not speculation, or because they are claimed by Shaye.\n\nFor example, it is most likely speculation to say “You must have planned this because of this information.”\n\nHowever it is definitely NOT speculation to say “Thor is divorced”. This information cannot be produced by speculation, and would only stem from claims made by Thor toward his community.\n\nDARVO [/asides/darvo], which stands for Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender, is a manipulative tactic used by abusers to deflect blame and shift the narrative.\n\nThor’s defense is a textbook example of DARVO. In this case, Thor employed DARVO to:\n\n * Deny all allegations made against him, claiming that he is not even married.\n   \n   > “Except he doesn’t and never did. Thor and I weren’t together and him and his wife are divorced.”\n\n * Attack Lyric, by accusing them planning the entire situation, and directly communicating with Lyric’s partner to attack their character.\n   \n   > “he was very happily interacting with us and chat and soaking up praise for donating so much. He continued to visit stream every day and talk with us afterwards”\n\n * Reverse Victim and Offender by portraying himself as the victim of Lyric’s attacks. “They are a ‘small indie studio’ that Lyric scammed. They are under attack because Lyric doxxed them.”\n   \n   > “Charging back… after giving it to a small indie studio… scamming us out of our income.”\n   > \n   > “As part of his attack messages he posted numberous chatlogs, some of which were modified and contained our lead developers personal phone number”\n\n\n“Thor is divorced.”\n\nThor was married to his wife, Nicole Gillett, from October 2015 to February 2020. We also know that they were living together until February 2019, which is before TwitchCon in October 2018.

The repetition of the word “attack” intends to evoke a sense of urgency and danger, and to paint Lyric as a villain.\n\nThis conversation led my partner to sympathize with Shaye, “I can’t forgive the fact that he basically doxxed you guys and thats a big yikes”.\n\nPartner:\nI can’t forgive the fact that he basically doxxed you guys and thats a big yikes\nShaye:\n[Lyric] can fix this on his end by deleting the posts / reversing the chargeback\n\n\nMy partner tries to convince me\n\nOn April 10, my partner did as they promised to Shaye; they tried to convince me to reverse the chargeback and delete all public posts about Thor. I expressed my distrust in them and disgust at how they are twisting the situation. My partner empathized with Shaye, trying to get me to consider that I might be at fault for misunderstanding the situation, and that I should stop harassing them.\n\nAt that point in time, I was not at all interested in deleting my posts because I felt I was in the right, and I would keep fighting to make it known because I have the proof.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nOn April 13th, my partner informed me\n\n> “[Shaye/Thor] are calling restraining order”\n\n> “I can’t just let them to call the lawyer on you”.\n\nI expressed that I heavily distrust them. I pointed out that they are asking me to delete for their own gain, so it would look like I deleted my posts because I regretted posting them (subtle foreshadowing…).\n\nI notice how my tone shifted over, from not wanting to delete at all, to wanting to mutually end the “drama”. I was motivated by having a happy life with my partner at the time, free of any past burdens.\n\nLooking back on this, I do regret not standing my ground. I did not have a good sense of boundaries at that age; if my partner told me to do something I would try to find a way, even giving up my own goals, and in this instance, my own emotional well-being. I realize now that this is not a virtue.\n\n\nDeleting my posts\n\nOn Apr 14, 2019, 12:34 AM PDT, my partner spoke to Thor.\n\nWell yeah. I'm not the aggressor here. If he calls off the attack all of this goes away pretty fast.\nPartner:\nAlright, just to make sure, if he delete every single things from Twitter, Discord, and everything on YouTube community, will you do the following same thing?\nThor:\nYep!\nSource: Thor's confirmation\n\n\nI took them at their word.\n\nIt is clear to me now that in this type of situation, I should know that deleting my posts in this situation is a terrible idea. Even without outside perspective, I should know that\n\n * they are are not trustworthy\n * they are manipulating my partner for the goal of manipulating me\n\nI led myself to believe their narrative to some extent. I never even checked if there was actually personal information leaked, since I did not review any of the contents of the archive before posting it.\n\nAfter I read Thor’s confirmation, I deleted all of my posts on all platforms, including the Google Doc [/aftermath/lyrics-google-doc] that I wrote.\n\nAt the time, neither Shaye nor Thor deleted their posts on the matter until years later. All of their posts on Twitter, Discord, and YouTube remained public, and they would continue to call me a scammer and a liar long after I deleted my posts.\n\nThis would confirm the foreshadowing I mentioned earlier.\n\nThey manipulated my partner to get me to delete my posts, and then they would keep their posts up, reinforcing their narrative and painting me as a villain.\n\n[/aftermath/thors-proxy-blackmail/twitter-up.png]\n[/aftermath/thors-proxy-blackmail/twitter-up.png]\n\nAt this time, I do not have original copies of my deleted posts.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nTranscripts\n\nConversations between Shaye and my partner, forwarded to me by my partner.\n\nShaye and Partner, Apr 7\n\nSource of forwarded messages\n\nShaye and Partner, Apr 9\n\nSource of forwarded messages\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nConversation between me and my partner, screenshot taken by me at that time.\n\nLyric and Partner, Apr 10\n\nLyric and Partner, Apr 13\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nConversation between Thor and Partner, on Apr 14m 12:34 AM PDT.

People who are willing to watch ARE there, you just have to cater to the audience that's engaging in your content. I know you're already super awesome when it comes to keeping up with chat, but there's always more that we can all do to better engage, which is again especially important for variety content.\n08:00\nWell as for the viewers then, my question to you is if you're streaming for you, for the fans, for the viewer count, or for Heartbound or something else.\n08:01\nI pop on dev streams with 50-60+ which is awesome.\n08:02\nAnd keep in mind that number is just how many people are free right now to watch you live, which is just a fraction of the fans that support you.\n08:06\nThe friend that introduced me to heartbound, his name is Pikabata and he fangirls anytime he sees anything about the game, not because it's Undertale 2, but because he believes that you're making something great. He doesn't really watch the streams because he's really busy but I bet you that there's hundreds if not thousands of people who love you for you and for what you're doing.\nT\n08:08\nThor\nI hope so\nL\n08:08\nLyric\nI know so 💝✨\nT\n08:08\nThor\nAnd I'm streaming for the fans to be real but of course it feels shitty to see our subcount dropping, and people caring less and bitching about Early Access or Sponsorships\n08:09\nBut to be real, without those things, we wouldn't have Heartbound\n08:09\nMy alternative is selling out to a major publisher\nL\n08:12\nLyric\nSome people just don't understand the reality of this stuff\n08:12\nWhat it's like to first of be a creator and secondly be a creator for a living\n08:17\nWhat I've found for me is, the best thing to do when I see someone being really rude or complaining about stuff they don't understand is to remind myself that the other people who care about me, who care about what I'm doing, that they are there for me, and I remind myself appreciate the heck out of them because I wouldn't be where I am today without them. Not all creators have the opportunity to connect with their fans on this level, but I'm so thankful that we're able to talk with those that care about us.\n08:21\nIt's easy to keep looking at the negatives because that's human nature, and it shows that you're frustrated because you don't know how you would be able to improve yourself as a creator to meet their standards. The idea of self improvement is baked into you, and that's awesome whether it's for yourself or those you care about. But don't let it be for the sake of those who don't care about you.\n08:23\nSo it's important to self-improve how you self-improve... Not just as a creator, but for your emotional sake as well... y'feel?\nT\n08:42\nThor\nI am super aware of all of this honestly.\n08:42\nYou're kind of misunderstanding how I feel about it on an emotional side of things.\n08:42\nI am aware that it is both a vocal minority and people who don't have my best interests in mind.\n08:42\nI'm aware that the majority of people have no idea what it's like to be a creator.\n08:43\nAnd I am not looking for more methods to self improve as a creator.\nL\n08:43\nLyric\nSorry for the misunderstanding—\n08:44\nI guess I should have figured you had that part under control ^^;\nT\n08:44\nThor\nWhat I am looking for is someone to say \"Don't worry about it, you got this.\" which is why I wrote Baron the way he is.\n08:44\nYou have to remember.\n08:44\nI've been doing this 10 years.\n08:44\nI'm 31\n08:44\nI've been through a lot of shit\nL\n08:44\nLyric\nRight...\nT\n08:44\nThor\nAnd dealt with a lot of people\n08:45\nI have a pretty good grasp of shit at this point\nL\n08:45\nLyric\n*pulls you into a hug~*\nT\n08:45\nThor\nThere ya go\nL\n08:46\nLyric\n^w^~\n08:46\nI'm much better at this than giving advice anyway =v=\"\n08:46\n*nuzzles you* I know I've said this before, but I really do believe in you. ^^\n08:53\nAnd...

I don't wait and hide things. I hate wasting time.\n09:37\nIf it had changed my mind\n09:37\nI would tell you, outright.\n09:37\nThe only thing that's bothering me right now is that you've been super wishy washy on everything.\n09:38\nOne day you're super interested the next you don't think we're compatible then you're telling me it's my choice.\nL\n09:39\nLyric\nI really took it too heart when you said that we should take things slow in terms of the relationship\n09:39\nAnd I never got any word of that stance changing\nT\n09:39\nThor\nWell yeah, I said that because you were talking about life changes and love within an hour. That's a bit fast by anyones terms.\n09:39\nTaking things slower means -slower- not reverse\nL\n09:39\nLyric\nYou're right, and I agree there\nT\n09:40\nThor\nAnd for all indications anything going that fast is going to fail and is most likely a product of desperation or rebound.\n09:40\nSo to make it not one of those things, I asked to slow things down.\n09:40\nbecause I actually give a shit\nL\n09:41\nLyric\nAnd I'm really appreciative for that\n09:41\nYou're good at seeing the bigger picture\n09:42\nAnd you always seem to know what to do, it's very admirable, really\n09:43\nI made some bad judgements and assumptions and I should have talked to you about it instead of taking it upon myself to put distance between us\nT\n09:43\nThor\nMaking decisions that effect both parties without them involved are legit never good.\nL\n09:44\nLyric\nYeah... sorry about that.\n09:45\nI should have talked to you about it.\nT\n09:47\nThor\nYeppo, at least you understand and we can move forward from that.\nL\n09:48\nLyric\nMhm—!\n09:48\nI think you said you were in a bad mood, I hope this wasn't because of me—\nT\n09:49\nThor\nNope, i'm in a bad mood because of the community.\n09:50\nYesterday one of our prominent members openly attacked me on stream claiming that I didn't care about the game and never do devstreams anymore.\n09:51\nThey have been actively telling people to -not- watch the gaming or sponorship streams.\n09:51\nStating that everyone should only watch Heartbound related content.\n09:53\nSo I had to write a public statement regarding where our studio gains income from, the state of our income as a studio, and how viewership impacts our income even without donations.\n09:53\nViewership is a big piece of the pie due to sponsorships and loots.\n09:53\nAnd when people try to campaign to undermine that, they are killing our studio and our games.\n09:54\nA side effect of this is that we didn't have the standard monthly income to responsibly go to Dreamhack this year.\n09:54\nDespite Dreamhack giving us a free table.\n09:54\nThey reached out to us\n09:54\nAnd offered a free 10 foot table\n09:54\nFor specifically Heartbound\n09:54\nAnd I had to turn them down\n09:54\nFucking Dreamhack\n09:55\nBecause of people bitching about sponsored streams and trying to drive others to reduce viewership.\n09:56\nThe thing is, megadonations are incredible but non-sustainable. You never know when someone like you will come along and inject a huge amount of funds.\n09:56\nViewership regularity is sustainable and easily translates to standard income.\n09:57\nBusiness is about reducing risk and keeping gold piles to sustain for bad days.\n09:57\nSo I do that, constantly.\n09:57\nAnyway\n09:58\nI'm removing these people from the community as they become more active. They aren't helping us in any way.\n09:58\nAnd that's the last step after talking to them, joking about it, telling them flatly, and then being serious.\nL\n09:58\nLyric\nFeels like they don't understand that the game they are pushing for wouldn't be possible without stuff like sponsored streams—\nT\n09:59\nThor\nThat's exactly the case\n09:59\nBest part?\nL\n09:59\nLyric\n*hugs...*\nT\n09:59\nThor\nAfter posting that?\n09:59\nSomeone compared me to Phil Fish\n09:59\nFucking incredible\nL\n10:02\nLyric\nI'm sure it'll get better as we get near to the early release ^^\n10:02\nPeople are just really antsy because they like your game, right? ^^\nT\n10:02\nThor\nHonestly it's not really about the game.\n10:02\nIt's about people wanting to be a part of something\nL\n10:03\nLyric\nThat makes sense— but the toxicity surrounding that is still inexcusable\nT\n10:03\nThor\nMost of these people don't care about the game, us, or the community.\n10:03\nThey want to feel important or special to others.\n10:03\nThat's the grand majority.\n10:03\nAnd that's how any celebrity material goes.\nL\n10:04\nLyric\nIt's good that you can discern those kind of people deal with it in a constructive way\nT\n10:04\nThor\nThey make up the bulk of any fandom.\n10:05\nAnd some of those people handle it in a toxic way.\n10:05\nI'm sure you have the same on your side.\nL\n10:05\nLyric\nI really haven't seen too much—\n10:05\nbut it's a different kind of community ^^;\nT\n10:05\nThor\nIt might be different with YouTube because it's free to sub.\nL\n10:06\nLyric\nYeah\n10:06\nI don't get too much financial support from the fans directly\nT\n10:06\nThor\nSo even with 100k subs a lot of that community is passersby\n10:06\nHonestly the majority of financial support I get is from the random megadonation and then sponsorships.\nL\n10:07\nLyric\nI didn't know sponsorships were such a large part of it\nT\n10:08\nThor\nThose sponsored game streams make more than bit donations monthly.\n10:08\nMegadonations > Sponsorships > Loots > Bits > Subs\nL\n10:09\nLyric\nThat's really awesome, considering you you typically seem to enjoy playing those games\n10:10\nI think you're one of the best people to do game sponsored streams because of your game dev knowledge; you can really get into analyzing and appreciating it ^^\nT\n10:10\nThor\nThe next game im working on will be less intense communitywise\n10:10\nSo im looking forward to it.\nL\n10:11\nLyric\nOh?

I want to use a game engine because I feel like it's a good groundwork for a graphics-based visualizer and it should be relatively efficient compared to traditional video compositing. The software would be very focused on aesthetics. Efficiency will be important as well, because, even though there will be an option to export videos, live playback would be a welcomed feature as well. I downloaded GameMaker Studio 2, Unity, and Unreal, and was planning to experiment with each one. I was wondering, based on your experience, which game engine do you think could be best utilized for my use case? (Doesn't have to be one of the ones I mentioned)\nL\n21:56\nLyric\nsorry I wrote so much ^^;\nT\n21:57\nThor\nYou've said efficiency a lot here but that could mean a lot of different things.\n21:57\nFocus more on what you are trying to make the executable do\n21:57\nNot how -efficient- it is\n21:57\nLet me know what that is\nL\n21:58\nLyric\nAh you're right. Efficiency, I meant as in, can handle lots of stuff on the screen but specifically effects or particles at high frames.\n22:01\n(While also having high graphics quality, but I don't know how much that has to do with the engine I'm using)\nT\n22:02\nThor\nThat's not going to be on the engine in the slightest\n22:02\nThat's going to be on the skill of the programmer\n22:02\nI can push GMS to have 30,000 physics objects emitting particles on screen at the same time\n22:02\nat 60fps\n22:02\non a phone\n22:02\nSo like\n22:02\nEngine is irrelevant\nL\n22:02\nLyric\nHm alright\nT\n22:02\nThor\nYou choose an engine based on limitation of functionality\nL\n22:04\nLyric\nHmm...

Because if you were more interested in me this wouldn't even be a question.\nL\n10:04\nLyric\nI suppose? But really it's not me starting stuff with him. I'm not seeking this kind of thing to happen. I'm not getting lonely and looking to hook up. That's not how it is.\nT\n10:05\nThor\nThe end result is the same though o.o\nL\n10:08\nLyric\nIt guess. But I think the mentality matters.\n10:09\nI'm not doing it because I'm disinterested in you.\nT\n10:09\nThor\nThe mentality on this doesn't matter much to me. Whether you are actively seeking it out or passively accepting it when it comes your way you're still hooking up with someone else.\nL\n10:10\nLyric\nAnd if that's not ok then I'll do my best to minimize that\nT\n10:10\nThor\nMinimize? What do you mean?\nL\n10:10\nLyric\nNot doing it again.\n10:11\nThat's all I mean by that\nT\n10:11\nThor\nMinimize and never again are two way different things lol\nL\n10:12\nLyric\nWell it's not a matter of what I say, it's a matter of what I do.\nT\n10:13\nThor\n._.\nL\n10:13\nLyric\nFrom what I understand, either way if it happens again you won't like it.\n10:13\nThe mentality on that doesn't matter so much, right?\nT\n10:13\nThor\nWell yeah if you want to continue stuff with me it has to stop.\n10:13\nPretty sure I've made that clear?\nL\n10:13\nLyric\nAlright.\n10:14\nThat's fine.\n10:14\nI just don't appreciate you leading me down this weird path to interrogate me when you didn't really wanna consider accommodating for that in the first place.\n10:15\nFeels like you just wanted me to confess something or like you're trying to teach me a lesson.\n10:16\nFeeling like you should've just asserted that you don't want something like that and left it at that.\nT\n10:17\nThor\nNope not trying to get you to confess something or teach you a lesson. Wanted to know exactly what is driving you and what kind of person you are.\n10:17\nYou're very caged off and don't communicate your feelings a lot of the time.\n10:17\nYou wait for others to ask or pry so I had to.\nL\n10:17\nLyric\nI'm not good at talking about myself.\n10:18\nIt still doesn't feel good.\n10:18\nI guess I took it in a way that you were considering accommodating for that and maybe that was just a bad assumption on my part. I just *feel* led on.\n10:19\nand maybe it's because I'm not used to people asking things just to ask\nT\n10:19\nThor\nI was never considering accomodating that and never said I was. I wanted to know what you were after so I could determine if I wanted to move forward. It's not deceitful in any way and I was upfront about it the entire time.\nL\n10:20\nLyric\nI understand, and as I said, it was probably just a bad assumption on my part.\n10:21\nAnd it still feels bad, even if it's my fault. Surprisingly, knowing that it's my fault doesn't make me feel better.\nT\n10:21\nThor\nUgh...\nL\n10:21\nLyric\nI was just\n10:22\ntalking about how I'm feeling ok\n10:22\nnot about who's right\nT\n10:26\nThor\nIt just doesn't really feel like you have my best interests in mind honestly.\nL\n10:27\nLyric\nI said I would stop for you\n10:27\nI assured you that I didn't mean anything by it\n10:28\nI then told you again I would try my best to stop\n10:28\nI proceeded to talk about my feelings\nT\n10:28\nThor\nYou also told me your ideal situation would be to have both me and them?\n10:28\nSo like\n10:28\nPretty big conflict of interest dude.\nL\n10:29\nLyric\nOf course there's a conflict of interest, but I expressed that I'd put aside my interests for yours.\n10:29\nThat's literally the opposite of not having your interests in mind\n10:29\nWe might have disagreements but you can't expect me to change my opinions for you\nT\n10:29\nThor\nNever said you should change your opinions.\n10:30\nMan you are seriously on a totally different communication wavelength than me.\n10:30\nPassive statements like \"I will try my best to stop\" and \"I will do my best to minimize that\"\n10:31\naren't hard statements of stopping the behavior\n10:31\nSo forgive me for not taking them as such\nL\n10:31\nLyric\nWell if your issue is with what I would prefer as a situation then that would be having a problem with my opinion.\nT\n10:31\nThor\nI set a pretty clear standard here. I'm not ok with other people being involved. If that's a problem for you then I think we're done here.\nL\n10:32\nLyric\nAnd to be fair I did say flat out that I wouldn't do it again multiple times.\nT\n10:32\nThor\nLook, clearly you're not getting it.\n10:32\nI don't want you to change in any way\n10:32\nI want to know who you are and bail if you're deadset on behavior I wouldn't be ok with.\n10:32\nThat's how this works.\n10:33\nThat's how literally every relationship works dude.\nL\n10:33\nLyric\nWell I think I've expressed that I'm literally not deadset on that behavior\n10:33\nBut it doesn't seem enough for you?\nT\n10:33\nThor\nYou seem stuck on thinking im trying to change you or force different opinions on you and I have no idea where that shit is coming from.\n10:34\nYou haven't though. You've said ideally you'd want to continue with him and then said you would diminish and reduce sexual interactions. Now you're saying you would stop.\nL\n10:34\nLyric\nYou stated that you don't feel like I have your best interests in mind because I told you that my ideal situation would be to have both you and him.\nT\n10:34\nThor\nCorrect\n10:34\nAnd that's 100% true\n10:34\nYou know what my ideal situation would be?\n10:35\nYou not doing this shit and being as loyal/interested as you stated when we met.\n10:35\nBut you're not, so, rip.\nL\n10:35\nLyric\nI said I'd minimize it. And that I'd try my best. Maybe you don't get it that I'm using that as meaning more, not less.\n10:35\nWhen I say I'll try my best that's not an excuse to fail.\nT\n10:36\nThor\nIt's passive and leaves the situation open to interpretation and slips.\n10:36\nNot interested in wishy washy.\nL\n10:36\nLyric\nWell let's be clear then.\n10:36\nI flat out said multiples times that I would stop, and when I said I'd try my best, I meant that I would assure that it doesn't happen again.\n10:37\nI say what I mean and I mean what I say.\nT\n10:38\nThor\nWell you have a hell of a roundabout way of saying what you mean.\nL\n10:38\nLyric\nOnly because you took it that way. >w>\"\n10:39\nIt's because you're trying to read me\nT\n10:39\nThor\nNo because you don't speak directly and i'm not trying to read you.\nL\n10:39\nLyric\nThere's always more than what I'm saying, isn't there?\nT\n10:39\nThor\nYou literally don't speak directly.\n10:39\nYou leave things open to interpretation, you act timid in conversation, and you leave options when confronted.\nL\n10:39\nLyric\nI said I'd try my best. What does that mean to you? That I wouldn't try my best?\nT\n10:40\nThor\nIt means that you leave open an opportunity to slip or fail. Doing your best doesn't mean it won't happen again.\nL\n10:40\nLyric\nIronically, saying it won't happen again doesn't mean it won't happen again either.\n10:41\nObviously that wouldn't be ideal.\nT\n10:41\nThor\nI really hate this.\nL\n10:42\nLyric\nI seriously don't see why. I flat out told you I wouldn't do it again. I am reassuring you now.\n10:43\nI'm disappointing and upsetting you right now because I'm not timid and I'm not just going along with everything you say.\n10:43\nSo why shouldn't I be timid?\nT\n10:44\nThor\nThis is clearly not going to work out\nL\n10:44\nLyric\nEven so I don't understand your rationale...\nT\n10:44\nThor\nYour interests are split and right now you're more interested in winning this conversation then you are in fixing the problem and making it up to me.\nL\n10:45\nLyric\nI told you I would stop\n10:45\nI have told you that several times and I told you that I told you that several times as well.\n10:46\nI'm not aware of what other steps to take in fixing the problem.\nT\n10:46\nThor\nYou don't get it and at this point I don't want to explain it anymore.\nL\n10:50\nLyric\nWell let's see. Either you have a problem with me doing it or you have a problem with what my idea of an ideal situation is.\n\nIf you still have a problem with me doing it then I told you that I wouldn't do it again. Then that shouldn't be the issue.\n\nIf you still have a problem with me wanting to do it then... Well, you assured me that you wouldn't want me to change my opinion. Even so, you could still have a problem with the idea of me wanting something like that even though I expressed I would put aside that idea, which seems to be what this is about.\nT\n10:51\nThor\nYour ideal situation is directly against my best interests. Changing your mind isn't something I'm about so this isn't going to work.\nL\n10:52\nLyric\nThat makes more sense.\n10:52\nI feel a little better about it now.\nT\n10:53\nThor\nIt's not really about how you feel honestly.\nL\n10:53\nLyric\nI know.\n10:53\nI guess I'm still a little used to talking about my feelings now, sorry.\nT\n10:53\nThor\nTo be real you don't seem to care about how I feel at all.\nL\n10:53\nLyric\nI... do.\nT\n10:54\nThor\nAnyway, hope that situation works out for you.\nL\n10:55\nLyric\n... Alright.\nT\n10:55\nThor\nYou've shown me that other things are more important dude. What did you expect from me?\n10:55\nYou seem surprised by this and it's nothing to be surprised about.\nL\n10:56\nLyric\nI wasn't surprised. You dismissed it pretty bluntly and so I figured there wasn't much else you wanted to talk about.\nT\n10:57\nThor\nWell I don't want to change your plans or mind. I want a partner that is in line with the same kind of relationship goals as me.\nL\n10:57\nLyric\nThat's fair and I agree with that.\nT\n10:59\nThor\nYou also don't seem to be taking this as any kind of big loss so.\n11:02\nTo be real all of this conversation and your reaction here just show me you don't really care about me.\nL\n11:06\nLyric\nI do care about you.\n11:07\nI wouldn't want to put aside my desires for you if I didn't\nT\n11:08\nThor\nMeh...\n11:10\nYou say that but it never really came across.\n11:13\nYou don't seem to be paying much attention to this anyway so I'm just gonna go.\nL\n11:20\nLyric\nI am in a lab right now sorry :\\\n11:21\nI'm sorry it didn't come across that way.\nT\n11:21\nThor\nWhy are you sorry?\nL\n11:22\nLyric\nBecause I want you to be happy.\n11:22\nI don't think I'm right for you and the converse is evident as well.\nT\n11:22\nThor\nYour words and your actions don't line up.\n11:23\nAnd I don't think you understand it's not just about being right for eachother or not. You've shown me a really negative side of you and I don't really want to talk to you after this.\n11:23\nYou don't seem to care about it, just passive and accepting, like you have been with everything.\n11:24\nThat's why you come across as uncaring.\nL\n11:24\nLyric\nI... don't mean to be that way. I do care about you.\n11:24\nI don't know what I can say right now.\nT\n11:25\nThor\nLike this whole time it hasn't been about fixing the situation, it's been about being the most right. And among all of that it's just been passive acceptance with little to no emotional backing.\n11:25\nSomeone who cares doesn't do this.\n11:25\nSo with that in mind, it shows that you really don't care about this that much.\n11:25\nMaybe because you have options, maybe because you just wanted a fling, who knows man.\n11:27\nThe only thing I want to impart to you in this is that if you want someone to know you care then show it in your actions. You didn't here and it broke it completely.\nNext messages [messages5.html]","routeStr":"/archive/telegram/messages4.html","title":"/archive/telegram/messages4.html","external":true},{"text":"Thor\nPrevious messages [messages4.html]\n1 October 2018\nT\n11:28\nThor\nBut hey, maybe you didn't care as much as I thought you did. Hah, anyway im gonna go back to bed.\nL\n11:28\nLyric\n... good night.\n11:29\nFor you it hasn't been about fixing it either. For you it was about whether or not it would work. That's not fixing it. There is no fixing it if the issue was with my opinion.\nT\n11:30\nThor\nNo point in fixing an issue that has nothing to do with me. You want someone else you get someone else. That simple.\nL\n11:30\nLyric\nI actually took steps to try to fix it be putting aside my desires for you.\nT\n11:30\nThor\nSo no, I am not invested in -fixing- you\n11:30\nAgain, you're just trying to win this. It's not helping and you're being an ass about it.\nL\n11:30\nLyric\nWell it seems like the issue you stated first was that we weren't fixing the situation.\n11:31\nI'm not trying to *win* this, you're just not making sense.\nT\n11:31\nThor\nNo dude the issue is that you fucked another guy online when you had plans to meet up with me and form a relationship. The second issue was that you went distant after doing so and acted like you had no idea our plans were that important. The third issue is that you wanted to keep him around and ERPing despite us working things out and planning to move forward.\n11:31\nYou fucked this up.\n11:31\nNot me\n11:32\nNow stop this shit\nL\n11:32\nLyric\nI understand that.\n11:32\nAnd I said that I would stop. I'm not sure what else you wanted.\n11:32\nFor me to denounce him?\nT\n11:33\nThor\nNo dude fixing your second mistake included never doing it again. Telling me your ideal situation would be to continue with him just further reinforced that you don't give a fuck about me.\nL\n11:34\nLyric\nThat's literally not the case.\nT\n11:34\nThor\nExcept every indication points to it being the case.\nL\n11:34\nLyric\nIf I didn't give a fuck about you I wouldn't be talking to you right now.\nT\n11:34\nThor\nAnd I wouldn't be talking to you either. I would have dropped your ass at the first sign of bullshit.\nL\n11:34\nLyric\nI understand that and I appreciate it.\nT\n11:35\nThor\nNow that bullshit has mounted so high that I just want to block you and be done with it.\nL\n11:35\nLyric\nI can't stop you, if that's what you wanna do.\n11:35\nI still care a lot about you.\n11:35\nEven past a relationship level.\nT\n11:35\nThor\nAgain, passive, pushing everything aside and just accepting anything.\n11:35\nFucks sake dude how much of this do I have to map out for you.\nL\n11:36\nLyric\nWhat do you want me to say? \"No don't block me please!\"\n11:36\nYou do what you want dude\nT\n11:36\nThor\nThen you do who you want. Clearly nothing I've done was going to stop that anyway.\nL\n11:37\nLyric\nExcept it was and I literally said I would stop >w>\"\n11:37\nYou either want me to change or you don't.\n11:37\nBut if you didn't want me to change you wouldn't be so upset about my opinion. Even though that's what you said. :\\\n11:38\nYou can say that this is just me trying to \"win\" or whatever but it's literally how it is.\nT\n11:39\nThor\nNo actually I just wanted you to choose a fucking side and stick with it. Saying you were going to stop and then saying you wanted to continue are legit opposite.\n11:39\nYou're wishy washy as fuck and just go along with whatever anyone says is the new standard.\n11:39\nAside from that I made it pretty fucking clear in the beginning that I wasn't into multiple partner shit and that I was into you and you still went off and e-sexed a dude.\n11:40\nThen you acted like it was some big mystery and that you never knew I was into you\nL\n11:40\nLyric\nI think you're just missing it. Saying I'll stop and saying I want it to continue aren't mutually exclusive at all.\nT\n11:40\nThor\nYou're either wilfully ignorant or a fucking abuser dude.\nL\n11:40\nLyric\nI seriously didn't know Thor.\n11:40\nYou fucked me within hours of meeting me.\n11:40\nWhat impression does that leave on me?\nT\n11:40\nThor\nDo people who aren't interested set up dates to meet up and talk about their futures together?\n11:40\nUse your fucking head kid\n11:41\nOr are you so deep in that furry life that you have no idea what an actual relationship even is anymore?\n11:41\nFucks sake\nL\n11:41\nLyric\nNo, they don't. I think it was pretty apparent from day one that I was interested. Otherwise I wouldn't have stuck to those plans.\n11:43\nIt's apparent that our ideas of a relationship differ. That's fine.\n11:43\nI'm not sure if that was meant as an insult but I'll try to take that in the best way.\n11:44\nI'm sorry I upset you.\n11:46\nI care about you and respect you a lot. As much as it hurt, I'm glad that we talked about it.\n11:47\nBecause... I'm very bad at saying how I feel. I'm sure you picked up on that.\n11:47\nAnd you're right that sometimes I just want to \"win\" and that's wrong of me.\nT\n11:47\nThor\nI still have no idea how you actually feel. Your words don't match your actions and you never show emotion in any of your reactions.\n11:47\nI don't know if you're happy, upset, whatever.\n11:48\nYou just seem like you feel justified in doing what you did while acting like you're being forced into a situation where you should feel wrong about it.\nL\n11:48\nLyric\nI didn't want to seem like I was being forced, I wanted to do it for you.\nT\n11:49\nThor\nAnd to be real wanting to end this has nothing to do with our relationship views. It has to do with the fact that all of this has led me to distrust you immensely.\nL\n11:49\nLyric\nI understand.\n11:49\n... I know I'm not good at expressing myself.\n11:50\nI'm tryin, but I'm sorry you have to deal with it\nT\n11:50\nThor\nYou have an opportunity to do so right now and you're not even taking it.\nL\n11:50\nLyric\n...—\n11:50\nI don't even know what I would say...\n11:51\nIt feels like anything I've said has only made things worse.\n11:52\nI liked spending time with you. Sometimes I would imagine us just working on something in the same room and it made me feel really happy and content. We didn't have to be working together on something, but we were working on something... with each other, yknow?\n11:54\nI have a hard time expressing myself.\n11:55\nSometimes I think I work all day so I don't have to socialize and deal with the anxiety knowing that I'll say something stupid.\n11:55\n... Like now, I'm just ranting about stuff that doesn't matter, and it wasn't what you were looking for.\n11:56\nBut I guess... I'm dumb for not knowing what I should have said instead.\n11:57\nI care about you and want to be your friend.\nT\n11:57\nThor\nYou said it so cleanly when you met me. Claiming love and devotion. Why is that impossible for you after a week?\n11:57\nSo again\n11:57\nYour words\n11:57\nDont fit your actions\nL\n11:58\nLyric\nBecause... it felt like I already lost, like it didn't even matter what I did or how I felt.\nT\n11:59\nThor\nThor, [01.10.18 11:50]\nYou have an opportunity to do so right now and you're not even taking it.\n11:59\nI can't do much more than literally tell you\n11:59\nlol\nL\n12:03\nLyric\nI'm not sure what I could say.\nT\n12:04\nThor\nSeriously?\nL\n12:05\nLyric\nI'm scared that anything I say isn't going to answer your question.\n12:05\nBecause that's pretty much what all of this has been.\nT\n12:05\nThor\nI've asked the same question like 50 different ways.\nL\n12:05\nLyric\nJust me not getting it.\nT\n12:05\nThor\nEventually one of them has to stick.\nL\n12:06\nLyric\nI'm... still not sure what I'm answering.\n12:06\nAre you asking if I still have feelings for you?\n12:06\nI don't think that's what you want me to answer, though...\nT\n12:07\nThor\n[stickers/sticker (60)_thumb (1).webp] stickers/sticker (60).webp\nL\n12:07\nLyric\nI understand that you shouldn't have to ask again\n12:08\nBut could you please ask very precisely? Even if you asked before.\nT\n12:11\nThor\nWhat, should I just ask yes or no questions then?\nL\n12:18\nLyric\nWell, I'm just having trouble recalling a particular question.\n12:18\nI'll try to answer as best as I can. If you feel like you should resort to that then that's something you could try.\n12:19\nBut right now I just... need a question.\nT\n12:19\nThor\nAlright here then. How can I believe that I am the important love interest to you if you're simultaneously wanting to continue online sex with someone else?\nL\n12:21\nLyric\n... Frankly, we have different values when it comes to that. It's evident that you value it as a lot more indicative to a committed relationship, which is not the same as how I value it.\n12:22\nAnd you were somewhat right when you called it a furry thing; maybe my desensitization to roleplaying is because I've been a furry.\n12:22\nIt just means different things to us. I did view you as my only love interest.\n12:23\nI understand you view it as not just a difference of valuing and you think there's something wrong with me because maybe there is. But I think this is the best way I can explain it. ^^;\nT\n12:24\nThor\nIt's not really a difference of values when one party is stating that it explicitly hurts them and you continue to do it.\n12:24\nThat just shows a lack of respect for the other person or a lack of care for their feelings.\nL\n12:25\nLyric\n... I guess I was neglectful of you.\n12:25\nI'm sorry.\n12:26\nI didn't really... see that. And you're going to say I should have seen it and you're right.\nT\n12:26\nThor\nWhat I said this is specifically why I said you don't care about me.\n12:27\nBecause in that situation you don't. You're more interested in continuing a tryst online then you are in moving forward with me.\n12:27\nThat kind of thing is exceptionally hurtful and even the idea of it being a decision that needs to be worked through on your end makes it more hurtful.\n12:27\nIf you're actually interested in someone things like that aren't a question. You just spend your energy on that person. Not extras.\n12:28\nFor me it just seems that you either don't care about me as much as you say you do or aren't ready for a committed relationship.\nL\n12:28\nLyric\nI do care about you...\nT\n12:28\nThor\nI did in-fact give you options for open and non-committed relationships early on after seeing this behavior.\n12:28\nBut you declined them and said you wanted to be with me.\n12:28\nYou can't have it both ways.\nL\n12:28\nLyric\nYou're right.\nT\n12:29\nThor\nThis is why i'm hurt and why I'm mad.\nL\n12:29\nLyric\nI'm sorry...\n12:29\nI did want to be with you\n12:30\nI don't know what else to say...\n12:30\nI want you to be happy.\n12:30\nI'm... evidently not very good at doing that.\n12:31\nBut it doesn't change the fact that... I care about you and want the best for you.\nT\n12:31\nThor\nIf it was your only relationship goal you would have been fine at it.\nL\n12:31\nLyric\nYeah...\n12:31\nwell...\n12:31\nTo be fair, you were my only relationship goal\n12:32\nLike I said, the erp was very much secondary to that\nT\n12:32\nThor\nHaving a side dude is a secondary relationship goal. Asking the guy you want to be with if he'd be ok with you continuing having erp with the side dude is a shitty thing to do.\n12:33\nAny human wouldn't be happy with that.\n12:33\nSeriously.\nL\n12:37\nLyric\nThor:\nAre you looking for multiple partners or an open relationship? c.c\nThor:\nIf you are, thats fine, I just wamt it communicated\n12:37\nNow I'm confused...\n12:37\nMaybe there's something I'm missing here and I'm certain there is.\n12:39\nSo it's... not fine to ask about it...?\nT\n12:40\nThor\nIt is fine that you want that. It's not fine if you want that and want to be with me.\nL\n12:40\nLyric\nOh I see.\n12:41\nI seriously misunderstood that.\n12:41\nWhat was fine was the wanting, not the open relationship.\n12:41\nUh\n12:41\nwow\n12:42\nI took that as an invitation to ask\n12:42\nI'm really sorry about misunderstanding\n12:46\nI... can see why you thought I was being a dick about it now...\nT\n12:47\nThor\nYep\nL\n12:47\nLyric\nI'm sorry\n12:47\nI seriously misunderstood that statement\nT\n12:58\nThor\nWell, what now?\nL\n13:00\nLyric\n...

I didn’t know the extent of the abuse that I was a victim of. I just couldn’t understand why I felt the way I felt, and the community feedback, charged by Thor’s narrative, made me question why lies and denial could define what is real.\n\nI was always afraid to think of myself as a victim. The words of the online community made me feel like an imposter.\n\nBeing accused of “appropriating the narrative” really stuck with me.

DARVO stands for “Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender.” The perpetrator or offender may Deny the behavior, Attack the individual doing the confronting, and Reverse the roles of Victim and Offender such that the perpetrator assumes the victim role and turns the true victim — or the whistle blower — into an alleged offender. This occurs, for instance, when an actually guilty perpetrator assumes the role of “falsely accused” and attacks the accuser’s credibility and blames the accuser of being the perpetrator of a false accusation.\n> \n>  * Jennifer J.

However, I do hope this will provide closure for me and finally allow me to heal. In many ways my motivation is similar to that of the past: to write this document because I feel like it’s the right thing to do.\n\nIn summary, I understand that my motivation now is neither entirely selfish nor entirely selfless. Rather it is a culmination of everything I have learned and felt, before, during, and after my interactions with Thor.\n\n\nPast\n\nAt the age of 20, my motivations for publishing this event are not entirely clear to me today. I believe that I lacked a higher motive other than to do what I felt was right. There was no motivation to resolve my emotional damage, nor to protect other people.\n\nIn my mind at the time, it was a linear cause-and-effect: if you harm somebody, you should be held accountable. At the time I believed that if I put everything out there, that people would understand the situation.\n\nIn that effort, I faced challenges that I never anticipated, and at the time, I was overwhelmed because I felt intimidated by\n\n * the confident lies told by Thor and Shaye, both to the public [/aftermath/lyrics-twitter-post] and to those close to me [/aftermath/thors-proxy-blackmail]\n * the trolling and backlash from the community on my first document [/aftermath/lyrics-google-doc]\n * threat to my livelihood as a content creator\n * threat to my relationship at the time, started 3 months after these events\n\nIt was ultimately the last fact that caused me to back out of this situation [/aftermath/thors-proxy-blackmail] in April 2019.\n\n\nInterim\n\nFor a long time after that, I thought the incident was an isolated case, and at the time I had no reason to suspect otherwise. It was not until some point in the future that I would receive a message from another victim (source will be provided if approved by this individual), that I learned that Thor has an established pattern of emotional abuse for sexual gain, and that all of the actions made by Thor are made intentionally, and in full self-awareness.\n\nThey expressed the fear of coming forward with this information, due to Thor’s cult following. The fear of losing everything triumphed over the need to warn others, and this is a feeling I related with.\n\nI learned that I was not alone in my situation, but there was also the burden of knowledge.\n\nI realize now that, after I learned of this, it was irresponsible of me to give up and delete my posts [/aftermath/thors-proxy-blackmail]. Given the opportunity to protect other people from similar abuse, I was still paralyzed by\n\n * threat to my livelihood as a content creator\n * the newfound guilt and regret of having convinced myself to stop fighting\n\n\nPresent - Retrospect\n\nI can see the lack of communication skills in my past self. This was partially due to my upbringing which rewarded academic performance over all else. I didn’t try to make personal connections with people because my validation was never based on that. My interactions with my community were very limited. Most of my friends at the time were those that reached out to me and put in the effort to maintain the friendship. Even within my own circles I always found it difficult to express anything in words.\n\nI have changed in many ways over the past 7 years. For the first time I have lived on my own, gotten my first corporate job, and learned how to work with people. I have learned about the efficacy of partial- and non-truths, planting thoughts, and other social engineering tactics, and utilizing that information I am learning how to protect myself against malicious influence. Only in the past year have I started my journey on truly learning how to communicate clearly with people.\n\nThor is 11 years older than I am. At the time of the incident, I was 20 years old, and he was 31 years old. Today, I realize the vast gap in the communication skills of myself and Thor at the time. I can only truly appreciate this difference today. In addition to Thor’s 11 years of extra age, he also excels in the field of social engineering, practiced for both work and in his personal life. The difference in experience will be illustrated in this document.\n\nI also understand today how I approached the situation was not the best for myself, nor the public due to how inexperienced and unclear I was.\n\n\n\n    \n 1.

They use it to make their targets feel worthless, defective, or corrupt.\n\nShaming is an abuse that we’re taught to inflict on ourselves. Targets absorb the hypercritical voices of their abusers so that, eventually the abusers don’t have to say a word.\n\n> TheraminTrees on Shame:\n> \n> Given all the distortions associated with shame it’ll come as no surprise that susceptibility to shame is strongly linked to a range of psychological symptoms and disorders including depression, anxiety, PTSD, eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harming and suicidal behaviour. The evidence is clear.\n> \n> With its focus on a specific act, guilt serves various psychologically adaptive functions helping to facilitate positive resolution. Meanwhile, with its focus widened to the whole person shame serves various maladaptive functions sparking aggressive defences that block positive resolution and lead to destruction and disorder.\n> \n> Targets of abuse often have a susceptibility to shame actively instilled into them in their earliest years through constant subjection to shaming. This can develop into toxic or malignant shame where the shame becomes a more or less perpetual state permeating the target’s thoughts, actions and experiences.\n> \n> For the shame-bound individual the process of overcoming abuse can feel like an assault course because even the steps they take towards health can inspire shame. Of the many kinds of manipulations abusers use on their targets — from gaslighting to infantilising to double binds — shaming is one of the most pernicious.\n> \n> Different abusers will inject different strains of shame into their targets based on their own hang-ups. Some abusers are obsessed with germs and dirt, neatness and order. Some are preoccupied with body image, sexuality, gender roles, social status. But in all cases the underlying message is the same: there’s something fundamentally wrong with you.\n> \n> Some abusers convey this message directly, openly telling targets they’re worthless, rotten, degraded. Many abusive religious groups plump for this option teaching targets to grovel to gods and ghosts to forgive them for their wretchedness.\n> \n> A more indirect method is to set impossibly high standards. Targets are often expected to exhibit superhuman qualities like infallibility, omniscience, telepathy. They’re expected to know exactly what to do and say at any given moment and punished when they inevitably fall short. In healthy environments, it’s understood that each of us is born fumbling and unprepared into a strange and bewildering world. Mistakes are expected as a natural part of learning to navigate that world and seen as a source of growth. Malignant shaming environments make few allowances for inexperience. Mistakes are taken as proof of innate stupidity, thoughtlessness, or deliberate troublemaking. Instead of growing, the target’s world shrinks.\n> \n> Over time, the abuser’s message is internalised changing from ‘there’s something fundamentally wrong with you’ into ‘there’s something fundamentally wrong with me’. This is where shaming surpasses manipulations like gaslighting and double binds.\n> \n> Shaming is an abuse we’re taught to inflict on ourselves.\n> \n> Targets absorb the hypercritical voices of their abusers so that eventually the abusers don’t have to say a word. The shame-bound individual is like a fox that’s been trained to hunt itself to exhaustion while the hounds sit back and enjoy the show. What’s more, the fox often continues to hunt itself long after the hounds have gone. Unlike gaslighting and double binds which stop the moment we cut our abusers out of our lives shame can persist long after we’ve ditched our abusers. Even after their death.\n\n\n\n","routeStr":"/asides/shame","title":"PirateSoftware Sucks - Shame"},{"text":"Who is Lyric?\n\nLast edited: Jun 8, 2025, 6:12 PM https://github.com/lyricwulf/piratesoftware/commits/main/src/routes/background/who-is-lyric/+page.svx\n\nHi, I’m Lyric. I was a college student, completing my undergrad requirements and double majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering. I was a full-time student taking 17 credits, equal to a minimum of 51 hours total academic engagement per week.\n\nPortrait of Lyric [/background/who-is-lyric/lyric.jpg]\nPortrait of Lyric\nPortrait of Lyric [/background/who-is-lyric/lyric.jpg]\n\nUntil the events described in this document, I maintained a GPA of 3.92 throughout my college career, and I was on the Dean’s List and President’s Honor Role every semester.\n\nI spent my free time making content for my YouTube channel, LyricWulf [https://www.youtube.com/lyricwulf], where I created piano arrangements for music from anime, games, and movies. I offered all sheet music and MIDI (music) files for free and without ads on my website lyricwulf.com [https://lyricwulf.com], and I made all of my content free to re-use with credit.\n\nAfter the events halfway through Fall 2018, my academic performance plummeted. I finished the Fall 2018 semester with a 2.76 GPA and was stripped of my honors accolades. The following semester I finished with a 2.57 GPA.\n\nAfter that semester, I dropped out of college.\n\nEven though I had more time to work on my content, I was unable to find any motivation. After the public fallout of the incident, I lost trust in online communities. I thought if I put my heart out and posted the chat logs, that people would hear me. However, Thor’s lies, in combination with his larger fanbase, drowned out all my hope with criticism. I was accused of doxxing him and fabricating the entire incident, and everyone believed him. I felt betrayed by everyone. By 2021, I stopped making educational resources, music, and I stopped posting everywhere.\n\nRead more on \"Effects On My Life\"\n[/aftermath/effects-on-my-life]\n\n\n","routeStr":"/background/who-is-lyric","title":"PirateSoftware Sucks - Who is Lyric?"},{"text":"Who is Thor?\n\nLast edited: Jun 8, 2025, 6:18 PM https://github.com/lyricwulf/piratesoftware/commits/main/src/routes/background/who-is-thor/+page.svx\n\nJason “Thor” Hall, at the time of the incident, was a 31-year-old content creator and streamer.\n\nPortrait of Thor [/background/who-is-thor/thor.png]\nPortrait of Thor\nPortrait of Thor [/background/who-is-thor/thor.png]\n\nDuring these events, Thor was living with his wife (referred to by Shaye as his “secret wife”).

I guess that would be obvious though, wouldn't it?\n1:14 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message67086]\n._.\n1:16 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message67087]\nColder now, Lyric is not getting closer to the answer he wants.\nOr rather I guess that's one of many end goals...\n1:17 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message67088]\nWell, I guess I wish you luck then. It's a good solid positive plan.\n1:19 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message67089]\nEven colder. The sarcasm is an expression of Thor’s frustration with trying to lead Lyric to the “right” answer.\n\nThor is fixated on having Lyric come to the conclusion themselves. Thor knows the effect of self-persuasion, and that Lyric is more likely to truly believe they wants to be devoted to Thor if they come up with the answer by themselves.\n*nod...* uwu\n1:20 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message67090]\nAt first I thought you meant with me but it's clear you didn't. I'm going to get back to coding.\n1:20 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message67091]\nThor disengages the conversation, punishing Lyric by denying him conversation, engagement, and attention.\n\nHe blames Lyric for being unclear, rather than asking them for clarity, because that would be guiding Lyric too closely. So, rather than asking Lyric and having them think it’s Thor’s desire, Thor victimizes himself. By framing Lyric as responsible for Thor’s emotions, Thor further encourages Lyric's thoughts and words to align with his expectations.\nI don't even know if you would want me after all of this.\n1:21 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message67092]\nI... like like you...\n1:22 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message67093]\n...

All he wants is absolute control over Lyric and their undying devotion, but he strictly does not want the label of dating, at least not publicly. How can he pull this off? It seems like an impossible goal, either he can say yes and have a label which he doesn’t want, or say no and he doesn’t get the devotion he does want. Or…\n\nTue, Oct 2, 2018\nAs long as we don't have any more surprises like this yes.

Thor makes it Lyric’s burden to prove that they are loyal only to him, even without the label of a relationship.\n\nNote that it is now in Thor’s best interest to then not bring up the topic again. The idea of complete devotion has been instilled in me. Thor has gotten exactly what he wanted, and he never brings up this conversation again so as to not stir the pot.\n\nRecall that Thor refused to accept any answer other than complete and willing devotion, and forced this discussion for several days until he got me to say what he wanted. Thor does not give me any alternative to saying this; by repeatedly initiating this discussion, he makes it so that statement is inevitable.\n\nIt’s suggested that this “pending relationship” is deliberately planned by Thor from the start. In the words of another victim:\n\n> “He uses not being in a relationship as a reason why he should not allow others to talk about it. Which is controlling. Which is what he says is why he doesn’t want a relationship because he doesn’t want to be controlled.”\n\n\nAnnotated Transcript\n\nTue, Oct 2, 2018\nGood afternoon~\n4:21 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message67095]\nThor, I would like to date you.\n4:52 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message67096]\no.o\n5:51 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message67097]\nI felt like I should be more direct about that.\n5:52 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message67098]\nYeah that's a much nicer change.\n6:25 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message67099]\nReinforces that Lyric needs Thor to approve.

This rapid progression can be overwhelming and make it difficult to see potential red flags.\n\nFor abusers, love bombing can be the first phase of a cycle of abuse, and is often followed by periods of devaluation and shame [/asides/shame]. The abuser may switch from intense affection to criticism, control, and even emotional abuse.\n\nFrom the abuser’s perspective, love bombing is an investment: it is a way to establish rapport, and can be later cashed out in the form of compliance, submission, and control.\n\nThe primary purpose of this article is to contrast with Thor’s demeanor in the Final Conversation [/twitchcon-2018/final-conversation], where he attempts to deny any advances toward Lyric:\n\nSat, Oct 27, 2018\nAs far as I knew we were fooling around and seeing if were comptaible. You've been pushing a lot for a committment kind of thing but I have a lot of work stuff going on and not a lot of time.\n5:08 PM [/archive/telegram/messages8.html#message73263]\nAfter facing confrontation from Lyric, Thor immediately denies any effort from himself in the relationship. This is in contrast to Thor's use of love bombing and his refusal to accept \"no\" from Lyric.\n\n\nDedication\n\nEarly on, Thor would establish a pattern of emotional dependence, seeming to mirror Lyric’s desires and emphasize them.\n\nTue, Aug 28, 2018\ni was just wondering if you wanted to hop into another call tonight and if not tonight then sometime else uwu\n8:33 PM [/archive/telegram/messages.html#message49116]\nYes -every day- like I said silly\n8:35 PM [/archive/telegram/messages.html#message49117]\nMy night stream starts in 20 min\n8:35 PM [/archive/telegram/messages.html#message49118]\nif you're awake after it we should call\n8:35 PM [/archive/telegram/messages.html#message49119]\nohhh right ^^;\n8:35 PM [/archive/telegram/messages.html#message49120]\nBut yes my plan is to be on voice chat with you every day c.c\n8:36 PM [/archive/telegram/messages.html#message49121]\nWed, Aug 29, 2018\nyou really make my life a ton better ^^\n11:10 PM [/archive/telegram/messages.html#message49406]\nYou make mine better too :3\n11:12 PM [/archive/telegram/messages.html#message49413]\nThu, Aug 30, 2018\nYou're so good to me c.c\n8:13 AM [/archive/telegram/messages.html#message49494]\n\nThor also expects the same dedication from Lyric, conveying his emotional dependence on them.\n\nSat, Sep 1, 2018\nOf course, thanks babe\n12:49 PM [/archive/telegram/messages2.html#message50349]\nMy pleasure 💝\n12:50 PM [/archive/telegram/messages2.html#message50350]\nmawr\n2:27 PM [/archive/telegram/messages2.html#message50353]\nuwu~!\n2:38 PM [/archive/telegram/messages2.html#message50354]\nhhhhh\n7:50 PM [/archive/telegram/messages2.html#message50355]\nHey Thor~\n7:52 PM [/archive/telegram/messages2.html#message50356]\nHow are you doing? ^^\n7:57 PM [/archive/telegram/messages2.html#message50357]\nNot great, surrounded by people\n7:59 PM [/archive/telegram/messages2.html#message50358]\nHow are you?\n7:59 PM [/archive/telegram/messages2.html#message50359]\n*hugs you gently*\n7:59 PM [/archive/telegram/messages2.html#message50360]\nMissed you today\n7:59 PM [/archive/telegram/messages2.html#message50361]\nSun, Sep 30, 2018\nBeen wonky lately\n10:32 PM [/archive/telegram/messages4.html#message64290]\nawh~ sleepy thor\n10:32 PM [/archive/telegram/messages4.html#message64291]\nwonky? you're finally getting to bed at a reasonable hour xP\n10:32 PM [/archive/telegram/messages4.html#message64293]\neven so, i hope you're not feeling too bad. do you feel ill?\n10:32 PM [/archive/telegram/messages4.html#message64294]\nNah not ill just missing you and hoping you miss me\n10:35 PM [/archive/telegram/messages4.html#message64321]\n\n\nUnconditional Support\n\nThor would show unconditional support for Lyric.

At this point, the conversation has lasted 7 hours.\n\n\n1. It seemed like a healthy discussion\n\nThis conversation goes over the goals of Lyric and Thor’s relationship. In this excerpt we will see that\n\n * Lyric states 4 times that they are not interested in a committed relationship\n * Thor states he is not interested in any arrangement where a sexual partner is not in a committed relationship with him.\n\nMon, Oct 1, 2018\nSome messages may be omitted from this excerpt.\nAre you saying you're interested in a casual thing with me but not a serious one?\n2:35 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65948]\nLyric has already expressed they do not know what Thor means by a casual relationship. It seems like an opportunity for them to change their answer from before.\nI'm attracted to you but I'm not ready for a commitment yet.\n2:36 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65949]\nLyric reiterates that they do not want a committed relationship (2).\nSo sexual stuff with me but also with others then?\n2:40 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65956]\nThis is Thor’s main concern.\nI just like, wanna be friends or close friends, y'know?\n2:41 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65961]\nLyric reiterates again that they do not want a committed relationship (3).\nquestion is important <_<\n2:42 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65968]\nI guess so, if that's something you'd be mutually interested in— though I'd still like to consider myself single for the time being.\n2:43 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65971]\nLyric reiterates again that they do not want a committed relationship (4).\nSo basically what you're saying is you want to be friends with benefits and be open to have sexual encounters with anyone else if you want to.\n2:45 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65974]\nNotice that Thor doesn’t ask Lyric if that’s what he wants. He tells Lyric.\nI don't know why that statement feels loaded somehow.\n2:46 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65977]\nNope, simple yes or no.\n2:47 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65978]\nYes or no on the straw man that Thor constructed. Notice the choices presented. If \"NO\", then Lyric wants a committed relationship. If \"YES\", then Lyric is not allowed to have an emotional connection with Thor (see next message). This is a false dichotomy.\nYes, but at the same time I don't want our dynamic to be based mainly on sex.\n2:48 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65980]\nAlright well I can't agree to that then unfortunately. Sexual attraction for me is based on emotional connection. If I don't feel important or like im special to the other person in some way then I can't really get turned on.\n2:49 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65983]\nThor knows that Lyric wants emotional connection. By tying these two concepts together, Thor is showing that in order for Lyric’s emotional needs to be fulfilled, Thor’s sexual needs must be fulfilled first.\n\nTo reiterate from before:\n\n * Lyric is not interested in a committed relationship\n * Thor is only interested in a sexual partner who is in a committed relationship with him\n\nIn the above messages, we see Thor acknowledge that their goals are incompatible.\n\nLet’s think about acceptable ways to proceed in this situation. (As an exercise to the reader, you may think about more ways about how you might proceed.) Try to guess which approach Thor will take.\n\nHypothetically:\n\n * Redefine the relationship, eg “Alright, I respect your decision to stay single. I value our connection and honestly want to keep you in my life, but for now it would be best to stay as friends”\n * Step back to establish emotional connection, eg “Let’s try focusing on our emotional connection—with no sexual expectations—and then reassess how we feel.”\n\nIt is at this point that I will mention again that Thor is 31 years old and Lyric is 20 years old. Think about that deeply for a moment, and then read each person’s goals and look at the options again. Does this 11-year age gap affect your answer?\n\n\n2. Thor doesn’t accept Lyric’s boundaries\n\nMon, Oct 1, 2018\nSo if it's a situation of me being one of the multiple friends with benefits kinda things I just wouldn't be into it.\n2:49 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65985]\nI understand.\n2:49 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65986]\nDoes that change any of your answers?\n2:50 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65987]\nInstead of disengaging the conversation after learning that Lyric does not want a committed relationship, Thor gives Lyric another opportunity to say what he wants. Thor still pushes for Lyric to be committed to him.\n\nAdditionally, we can see that Lyric’s last two messages “Fair enough”, “I understand” are not satisfactory to Thor, and those were meant to give Lyric an opportunity to chase after him again.\nHmm.......\n2:50 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65988]\nYes.\n2:50 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65989]\nI want to be friends or close friends.\n2:50 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65990]\nLyric reiterates again that they do not want a committed relationship (5).\nI think I'm not ready for commitment quite yet, having a couple loose ends to tie up first. I also think we should get to know each other more before we consider a committed relationship anyway.\n2:51 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65991]\nLyric clarifies so that there is no misunderstanding; Lyric does not want a committed relationship (6).\nDating isn't committed. It just means not boning other peeps while you test stuff out.\n2:52 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65994]\nBy now, it’s established Thor wants a committed sexual relationship, while Lyric does not want any form of commitment. It is clear that Lyric’s wants and Thor’s wants are incompatible. It would make sense to drop it at this point. However we see Thor is refusing to let Lyric go, still trying to convince Lyric to devote themselves to him. He is not taking no for an answer\n\nRead the message again. If you think that sounds weird, and that “not boning other peeps” is the commitment of dating, then you are very much not alone. Why would Thor say something so absurd? Well, take into account the power dynamic. Lyric, at age 20 and unsure of their own stance as evidenced in the conversation prior, is in no position to challenge this statement from the older and wiser Thor. This is not the first time Thor says something absurd that reshapes Lyric’s reality.\n\nThen, why make this leap in logic? Thor takes this stance because Lyric has been reiterating that they do not want a commitment. It’s phrased so that Thor can get what he wants while convincing Lyric it is also what they want.\n\nBy now, it’s established Thor wants a committed sexual relationship, while Lyric does not want any form of commitment. It is clear that Lyric’s wants and Thor’s wants are incompatible. It would make sense to drop it at this point. However we see Thor is refusing to let Lyric go, still trying to convince Lyric to devote themselves to him.\n\nRead his last message again. If you think that sounds weird, and that “not boning other peeps” is the commitment of dating, then you would be very much correct. Why would Thor say something so absurd? Well, take into account the power dynamic. Lyric, at age 20 and unsure of their own stance as evidenced in the conversation prior, is in no position to challenge this statement from the older and wiser Thor. This is not the first time Thor says something absurd with the goal of reshaping Lyric’s reality.\n\nSo, he can reshape reality, but why make this specific leap in logic? Thor takes this stance because Lyric has been reiterating that they do not want a commitment. It’s phrased so that Thor can get what he wants (commitment) while convincing Lyric it is also what they want (not commitment).\n\n\n3. Thor says “close friends” aren’t real\n\nMon, Oct 1, 2018\nAlso what does \"close friends\" mean?\n2:52 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65996]\nClose friends as in friends but close... Wow that sucks\n2:53 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65997]\nI guess I just mean friends.\n2:54 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65998]\nYeah lol\n2:55 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message65999]\nGlad you see how that made no sense\n2:55 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66001]\nSubtle, but Thor again changed Lyric’s reality. It should be obvious to anyone that “close friends” exist. Thor is taking advantage of Lyric’s young age and inexperience. In this world, Thor gets to define what is real. Lyric must adjust their reality to align with what Thor says.\nSometimes I just need some sense knocked into me. uwu\n2:57 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66002]\nLyric has been conditioned to accept Thor’s statements as truth, and blame themselves for misunderstanding.\nYou seem to answer stuff in super weird ways\n3:00 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66003]\nDoubles down on the blame that was just assigned. This does two things\n 1. blames Lyric for the “misunderstandings” that happen, and\n 2. establishes Thor’s world as fundamentally superior to Lyric’s\n\nThis is a prime example of gaslighting!\nI don't mean to.\n3:01 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66004]\nAnd your term Close Friends just sounds like an Open Relationship?\n3:01 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66006]\nThor uses \"your term\" to call Lyric's viewpoint inferior and flawed.\nNot what I meant since I believe that's out of the question.\n3:02 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66007]\nFishing for approval\nYeah I wouldn't be into that.\n3:02 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66008]\nFor me it's like just focus on being sexual with one person at a time.\n3:02 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66009]\nWhile he is saying this is what he does (\"for me\"), this is not truthful because of Thor's marriage with his wife and his sexual relationship with Shaye. Thor is simply stating how he wants Lyric to behave.\nAny more than that and you can't give them the attention they deserve anyway\n3:03 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66010]\nI understand. That seems to make the most sense too.\n3:03 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66011]\nBut yeah if you're still have active stuff with others no cuddly stuff at TwitchCon with me.\n3:04 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66012]\nPartially because it feels bad, partially because it's dangerous healthwise.\n3:04 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66013]\nClearly establishing boundaries, followed by self-victimization and appeal to logic. Though I do agree it is dangerous healthwise to have multiple partners, it should be noted that Thor’s concerns have been with roleplaying up until this point, and he repeatedly tries to blur the line between roleplaying and physical sex.\n\nWhile the last part of his message doesn't really make sense in this context (roleplaying), he places this factual statement last as sort of an anchor for his argument. Think about it this way, Lyric cannot argue that it is dangerous to have multiple sexual partners in real life, and if Lyric argues any other point he will call Lyric out for ignoring the \"most important point\"\n\n\n4. Thor says you are already committed\n\nWe see that Thor continues even further to try to convince Lyric that they want to date him.\n\nMon, Oct 1, 2018\nAlright so\n3:31 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66106]\nYou're not a sexcrazed skeeze\n3:32 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66107]\nYour're an awkward dumbass who doesn't know what words mean and actually wants to be with me but has loose ends with people online and ONLY online.\n3:32 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66108]\nRight or Wrong?\n3:33 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66109]\nRight ;w;\n3:33 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66110]\nAlright, with that in mind, I am good with being with you at TwitchCon and more than that.

Because I have established you are inferior and stupid in every way, you will be trained into believing that your wants are second to my approval.\"\n*nod nod...*\n3:38 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66114]\nI feel really dumb ;w;\n3:38 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66115]\nWhy?\n3:39 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66116]\nBecause like\n3:39 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66117]\nI threw you for a whole trip because I didn't know how to words\n3:39 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66118]\nBlaming self for everything.

Dating may mean different things to different people. It’s important for everyone involved to establish clear expectations and commitments. Like, if you want to sleep with other people while dating, you should probably run that by anyone you are dating. I don’t think there is anything malicious here, this highlight is just Thor’s own perspective (or at least the perspective he wants Lyric to have).\nDating is meant to be casual so you can see if people are a good match.\n4:22 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66216]\nIf you find a good match, that's essentially the term \"Going Steady\" or \"boyfriend\"\\ etc\n4:23 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66217]\nThen you don't touch other people and you don't cheat on them\n4:23 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66218]\nUnless you're into that and the relationship is open etc\n4:23 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66219]\nRight now im like hey yo, you want to date?\n4:23 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66220]\nAnd you're like, no I don't want to get married.\n4:23 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66221]\nAlso im fucking this other guy online.\n4:23 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66222]\nwell I don't want to get married ;v ;\n4:23 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66223]\n*Fingerguns*\n4:23 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66224]\nNow do you see how what you're saying makes no sense?\n4:24 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66225]\nLook, to be real, this is stupid.\n4:25 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66226]\nEither you have no idea how any type of human interaction works for this kind of thing or you're playing me because you just want to keep e-fucking your friend and don't know what to do now that we've gotten involved with eachother.\n4:25 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66227]\nIt shouldn't be very surprising, considering Lyric is 20 years old and has no IRL dating experience.

Usually this is not what people fixate on. “You said that you loved me, that you want to be with me forever, that you would give me all of your money” just seems a little unsettling to me. Surely this is just speculation…\n\nLet’s explore this for a moment.\n\nThor is referring to a single message that Lyric sent:\n\nthat one night i asked you how much to make heartbound free i was thinking about dumping my entire savings into it but what i have is nowhere compared to what those companies offered you xP\n9:58 PM [/archive/telegram/messages.html#message50017]\nThor remembers this for a long time.\n\nIt was only mentioned in conversation that one time, and Lyric also made numerous donations to Thor. But isn’t it interesting that this is one of the core facets that Thor remembers?\n\nHe remembers that small quip. But why recount this detail specifically? Why not\n\n * Lyric asking for sleep calls?\n * Lyric staying up late for Thor, even though they have 8am classes?\n * Lyric acting like a pet?\n\nThere’s something more here.\n\nThis is selective memory at play. He’s not telling us what happened in the past, he is telling us how he saw Lyric at their best. It’s a description of his ideal version of Lyric.\n\nNot only is that his ideal version of Lyric, he deserves to have that Lyric. Sad hyena tells us that Thor is “hurt” and sees Lyric as taking away that vulnerable and obsessed version of themselves. You will see in these upcoming messages that Thor desperately wants to get down to the bottom of this: why did Lyric stray from this path? And more importantly, what can Thor do now to keep Lyric under his control?\n\n\nThor Wants Obsession\n\nMon, Oct 1, 2018\nIf you werent ready to date you wouldnt be trying to date me and be with me at twitchcon you bigass baby\n5:05 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66259]\nAre you sure? **Lyric is 20 and says they aren’t ready to date, that should be a big blocker for Thor.

I believe he recognizes his comment drove Lyric farther away than he wanted to, and he views it as a blunder. So, he is playing defensively in this statement, and now he is trying to convince Lyric why that statement was justified, eg “You need me to say things like that to keep you in check!”.\n\nThor is frustrated, because it wasn’t a blunder, until Lyric “misinterpreted” what Thor was saying.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nAnnotated Transcript\n\nMon, Oct 1, 2018\nHis mate knows and the erp isn't me trying to get with them or anything\n4:34 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66244]\nand\n4:34 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66245]\nThen what's the point!\n4:35 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66246]\nAn appeal to logic: \"Lyric is dumb because of their feelings.\"\nI... guess there's no point.\n4:35 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66247]\nsticker [/media/sticker/75.webp]\n4:37 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66248]\nBoy you gotta get your priorities straight.\n4:40 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66249]\nI know...\n4:40 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66250]\nsticker [/media/sticker/69.webp]\n4:50 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66251]\nYou've said a lot of wild shit since we met.\n4:51 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66252]\nSaid you loved me, said you would give me your entire savings, wanted to live with me, wanted to be with me forever, now you're talking about hookups even though they weren't hookups and how you want to keep erping with a dude online despite him being with someone and it being not ok for me and stopping us from moving forward.\n4:52 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66253]\nAnnotation\n\nFor all intents and purposes you either didn't mean those initial things you said to me or you don't mean the ones you're saying now.\n4:53 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66254]\nThe only thing stopping us from moving forward is that I don't know if I'm ready to date yet.\n5:01 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66255]\nI like how you glossed over all of that and came to say this. lol\n5:01 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message66256]\nNotice the double standard here.

Lyric consoles him by saying it’s only been two days and also suggests adding a higher tier. (Thor mentions the Kickstarter might fail)\n\nThor tells Lyric that he made a higher tier at $500. After informing Lyric of the new, higher priced tier, Thor then ignores Lyric, and when nudged, he responds with “hrm?” as if Lyric was being annoying.

Just as you did with me, you will plant seeds of doubt into your audience, and make them feel like they came up with the conclusion themselves. Something along the lines of “he is just reading off a script” or “look at how he plays it up for the camera”, pointing out these small tells as if the entire thing is a convoluted fabrication for my own personal gain. What are you going to do when people start to realize that angle cuts both ways? Yes, what if they realize, that if they looked at your actions through the same lens, then you would have been caught 7 years ago…\n\nSome part of me really wants to thank you. Only recently have I learned to feel happy and content with my life. Off camera, my life is flourishing. But it was you who taught me this: I did not become who I am because of you. I became who I am in spite of you.\n\nOver time I learned the importance of recognizing patterns. Yes, one occurrence may be a coincidence, but more than that establishes a pattern… It’s interesting Shaye was 21 years old when they moved in with you in 2017. And I was 20 when you manipulated me. And another victim at 23… Your patterns and motives are clear as day.\n\nHaving spoken to other victims of yours, I would always hope that one of them would speak out. Only now do I realize how impossible that is. You identify people who are emotionally weak, with low self-esteem so you can form and mold them into your pet. As part of your indoctrination you shower them in praises, you train them to need, to live and breathe your approval. Then you punish them for acting against you, you berate them for any deviation from “yes master”, and you make them feel shameful about who they are without you. They are terrified that you would use your fanbase to retaliate against them, just as you did to me. Get his friends gossipping about him, and even though their demeanor is sympathetic towards him, he can never really be sure if they even believe him. Tell me, how can one ever trust again after facing that?\n\nSo to avoid that situation, we try to forget. Every night we fight away thoughts of you: What if that never happened to me? Who are you abusing now? Who will you abuse next? And a question I can never get out of my head: What do you really think? They say “the tree remembers but the axe forgets”…\n\nI lay awake every night wondering if you still remember me. After what you put me through, do I even grace your mind or memory? Do you ever think about how you ruined my life? Do you think you got away scot-free? Or maybe do you dread that one day, you’ll find you didn’t cover all your tracks? That I will finally grow up, shed my insecurities, and realize that I don’t have to hide anymore…\n\nLetter to Thor\n2 / 2\n\nI’m still not even close to the age you were when you abused me. That really puts into perspective for me, just how pathetic you really are. You are willing to destroy the minds of young and vulnerable people, for the sake of financial gain and sexual gratification. You ruin lives to get your dick wet. How pathetic for a man your age… God, you’re like 40 now! I can only imagine you have gotten better at what you do.\n\nYou are a parasite. You feed on others’ praise and worship. You expect to be treated like a god. Well, I’ve been studying your words for the past few months. You should be scared. Because, back then, I didn’t even realize how easily identifiable your tactics were. I can see why you were so desperate to get me to delete my posts. You were so desperate that you manipulated my partner into believing that I am a liar and that I wanted to start drama from a simple misunderstanding.\n\nAfter I finally went back, finally re-read every single message, I find myself angry. I’m angry that you knew exactly what you were doing all along. I’m angry that back then, I only called out that you liked to sleep around. I’m angry you were so good at it that I never even realized the damage until 7 years later.\n\nHow naive I was in thinking it was just infidelity and not communicating between sexual partners. No, you’re not just a threat to your partners, you are a threat to everyone. So long as you have a platform, you will continue abusing your power over more and more victims. We need to take your platform away so at the very least, you won’t have easy access to vulnerable targets in your younger audience.\n\nI cannot even begin to imagine how many lives you have ruined, because I guarantee that I have not spoken with everyone who has faced your abuse. How many people haven’t I heard from? How many will speak up now that I have come out of the dark? There is no repentance you can give, no excuse you can conjure that would atone for your disgusting actions.\n\nI’m writing myself into your story now. For as long as I live, I will never stop fighting for myself and your other victims. I no longer have the same weaknesses I had back then. This time, I have no online career to worry about. I have no partner for you to manipulate. I have no shame in who I am anymore.\n\nThis time, I am not afraid of you.\n\n- Lyric\n\n\n\n","routeStr":"/letter-to-thor","title":"PirateSoftware Sucks - Letter to Thor"},{"text":"Preface\n\nLast edited: Jun 3, 2025, 6:44 PM https://github.com/lyricwulf/piratesoftware/commits/main/src/routes/preface/+page.svx\n\nThis document aims to summarize all information about the interactions between myself (Lyric) and Jason Thor Hall.\n\nIn pursuit of clarity, I will do my best to include as many details as I possibly can without harming others, including those of my own behaviors and mistakes.

However, I recently started to see Thor resurge on online platforms. I decided to write a Google Doc about my experience with Thor.\n\nAt first, I was going to point out his hypocrisy when he accused me of cheating on him when I roleplayed with someone else. I documented each conversation, putting together my traumatic experience, bit by bit, in a way I did not previously comprehend. Over time, it evolved into this website.\n\nThor’s friend and business partner Shaye (aka RiverMakes, FlSHB0NES), aged 22 at the time—while at first sympathetic to my situation—would ultimately be a willing accomplice to Thor silencing me.\n\nThis document contains content that may be disturbing, including emotional abuse, manipulation, and adult themes including sexual exploitation and infidelity. Please read at your own discretion.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nHow I Met Thor\n\nOn my YouTube channel I would upload piano transcriptions of music from video games, among them indie games such as Undertale, Celeste, and OneShot. In February 2018 I would transcribe and publish a track from Thor’s game, Heartbound. We started talking shortly after, with our conversations mostly revolving around copyright and content creation.\n\nOn August 26th, 2018, I would make a large donation of $800 to Thor while he was streaming the development of his game. From that moment onward, Thor suddenly expressed immense romantic interest with me. On the next day, August 27th, Thor would, unprovoked, initiate erotic roleplay with me. Our “love” would continue to blossom.\n\n\nConstructing Commitment\n\nHe started to shower me with affection, praise, and attention, making me feel special and valued (love bombing [/conversations/love-bombing]). However, when I would express any reluctance to commit to him and solely him, he would shame me by calling me corrupt or clueless [/conversations/cheating].\n\nThor specifically says his ideal version of me is infatuated, obsessed [/conversations/thors-goals#thor-wants-obsession], and willing to donate all of my money [/conversations/thors-goals#thor-wants-money] to him.\n\nWhen I told him repeatedly that I was not interested [/conversations/no-means-yes#1-it-seemed-like-a-healthy-discussion] in a committed relationship, Thor insisted that I change my mind [/conversations/no-means-yes#2-thor-doesnt-accept-lyrics-boundaries], not taking “no” for an answer. Among the tactics he employed, he tried to gaslight me into believing that I was already implicitly committed to him [/conversations/no-means-yes#4-thor-says-you-are-already-committed] by virtue of having no love interests in my life.\n\nAfter he manipulated me into asking him to date me, he was able to convince me to act my part of a committed relationship without being “official”, by blaming my reluctance (saying no to him several times):\n\nAs long as we don't have any more surprises like this yes. I'd like a week for things to calm down.\n6:27 PM [/archive/telegram/messages5.html#message67103]\nAnnotation\n\n\n\nTwitchCon Meetup\n\nThroughout our conversations he constantly pushed for us to meet at TwitchCon 2018. He would regularly bring up how nice it would be to see me there and how we would have a lot of “fun” there, even counting down the days til we meet [/conversations/love-bombing#meeting-up].\n\nWe met up at TwitchCon 2018, as planned, on October 26.\n\nOn the first day, we roamed with Shaye and some other streamers. By night, the group went to a bar, but I could not join since I was underage. Later that night, Thor excused himself from the bar to join me in my hotel room.\n\nOn the second day, while we were roaming without Thor, Shaye mentioned that Thor has a “secret wife”. After we went back to Thor’s hotel room I messaged him asking about a wife, which he denied and blamed me for “misunderstanding”. [Final Conversation [/twitchcon-2018/final-conversation]]\n\nSince Thor refused to talk, I decided to message Shaye about it.\n\nI explained my situation to Shaye, and when asked if it was true, I sent screenshots of the conversation where I guided Thor to my hotel room. Shaye was sympathetic, and they would tell me that they and Thor were sexual partners, and that they were in an agreement to be open at the con as long as they communicated it with each other. [Recollection of TwitchCon [/sources/recollection-of-twitchcon]]\n\nShaye was devastated that Thor broke their trust by sleeping with me, and messaged Thor about his uncommunicated infidelity. Thor blamed me and denied any involvement with either myself or Shaye.\n\nDon't really care dude, nothing is even going on.\n6:40 PM [/archive/telegram/messages8.html#message73304]\n\n\nI left the room, and he blocked me.\n\n\nPublic Fallout\n\nIn early March 2019 I charged back [/aftermath/lyrics-chargeback] a donation of $800 made in August 2018. Thor would publicly call me out [/aftermath/thors-publicization] by name and make posts on Twitter, painting me as a scammer. On April 1st 2019 Thor filed a DMCA claim [/aftermath/thors-copyright-strike] against my YouTube channel.\n\nOn April 5th 2019, I posted about the strike [/aftermath/lyrics-twitter-post] on Twitter, and Thor would continue calling me out on the chargeback. I responded with a Google Doc [/aftermath/lyrics-google-doc] recounting my experience with Thor at TwitchCon.\n\nIn the past 5 years he deleted his original Discord announcement addressing the situation (as well as all messages in his Discord around that time [/sources/thors-discord]).\n\nHowever, considering members of his community as well as Shaye claim these “facts”, we can conclude that this information comes directly from Thor.\n\nThere were three aspects to Thor’s defense [/aftermath/thors-defense]:\n\n * “Thor is divorced.”\n * “Lyric doxxed Thor.”\n * “Lyric planned this and he is a scammer.”\n\nIn reality:\n\n * Thor was married from October 17, 2015 to February 18, 2020 [/sources/thors-marriage].\n * None of the published messages, images, or metadata included any personal information except for Lyric’s phone number occurring twice. The Telegram Archive [/sources/telegram-archive] has never been edited, remaining unchanged since its export in 2018.\n * Thor’s actions toward me were focused on financially exploiting me [/donations/donate-your-savings]. He would also reward me with unprovoked sexual attention [/donations/kickstarter] after large donations.\n\nHis defense was effective at the time, as the public has no greater knowledge about any of these facts.\n\nHe had reasonable deniability for his marriage since it wasn’t publicized.\n\nHe told the online community that I publicly leaked his phone number. He claimed that there were attacks on his personal phone number.\n\nMembers of his community would claim this publicly, and Shaye would also use this as a reason to convince my partner to convince me to delete my posts.\n\n脂肪化け猫 @Bakenekoshiboo [https://twitter.com/Bakenekoshiboo]\nReplying to @Precision011 [https://twitter.com/Precision011] @Akkifireborker [https://twitter.com/Akkifireborker] @LyricWulf [https://twitter.com/LyricWulf] @Nightwoods_ [https://twitter.com/Nightwoods_] @ItsAMoosh [https://twitter.com/ItsAMoosh] @Themexicancraf1 [https://twitter.com/Themexicancraf1] @PirateSoftware [https://twitter.com/PirateSoftware]\nI agree, but, Lyric released telegram chat logs, which include Thor's REAL PERSONAL phone number, so he's essentially gotten doxxed, and people have already started subscribing him to shit with his number.\n4/5/2019, 9:35:22 PM\n0\n0\n0\n0\nhttps://x.com/Bakenekoshiboo/status/1114386086766108672\n\n\nMy Silencing\n\nThor was able to lie so confidently that even I would end up believing him. At the time I didn’t read back through the chat logs so I didn’t know that his phone number wasn’t actually there.\n\nI found another romantic partner in January 2019. Thor and Shaye would contact my partner to convince them of my wrongdoing. They told my partner that I doxxed them, attacked them, and proposed a solution (source [/aftermath/thors-proxy-blackmail#shaye-lies-to-my-partner]):\n\nShaye:\nhe can fix this on his end by deleting the posts / reversing the chargeback\n\nConvinced by Thor and Shaye’s lies and manipulation, my partner would give me an ultimatum, that I have to drop the “drama” and delete all my posts in order to show that I care about our relationship. My partner assured me that Shaye was trustworthy because they are friends of a friend, and assured me that Thor was trustworthy because he agreed to delete his posts [/aftermath/thors-proxy-blackmail#deleting-my-posts].\n\nOn April 14th 2019, I was coerced to delete all of my posts. However, Thor and Shaye did not delete any of their messages as promised, instead leaving all of their Twitter replies and Discord posts public, making it look like I was remorseful because my “stunt” didn’t work and further cementing the image of a “scammer”.\n\n\nEffects On My Life\n\nDuring these events, I was in college, double majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering. I maintained a 3.92 GPA over my first four semesters. After the events mid-Fall 2018, my next GPAs were 2.76 then 2.57. After that semester, I dropped out.\n\nIn April 2019, when I tried to speak out, Thor turned everyone against me. I thought if I stayed honest, that I would at least be given an oppurtunity to explain myself. Instead, I had people vandalize my Google Doc [/aftermath/lyrics-google-doc], say I was appropriating the narrative [/asides/community-feedback] of real victims, and accuse me of doxxing and attacking Thor [/aftermath/thors-defense#lyric-doxxed-thor--altered-messages].\n\nI felt abandoned by everyone. What was once a desire to create free educational content was replaced by feelings of inadequacy and abandonment. I posted less and less, and I stopped making content entirely in 2023.\n\nRead more on \"Effects On My Life\"\n[/aftermath/effects-on-my-life]\n\n\nRecent Events\n\nOn Feb 22, 2025, Shaye deleted their replies to my tweet [/sources/recent-events].\n\n\n\n    \n 1.

He would regularly bring up how nice it would be to see me there and how we would have a lot of “fun” there, even counting down the days til we meet [/conversations/love-bombing#meeting-up].\n\nI wanted to room with Thor and Shaye since it would have cost around $500 for me to room by myself. He would remind me almost daily to book my own hotel room, insisting it was the only way we would have “alone time”.\n\nWe met up at TwitchCon 2018, as planned, on October 26.\n\n\nThe First Day\n\nOn the first day, we roamed with Shaye and some other streamers. At 7:30pm, the group went to a bar, but I could not join since I was underage. I went back to my hotel room, and messaged Thor saying I had lots of fun hanging out. Thor then asked when we can meet up.\n\nThor asks to meet up\n\n\nAt 9pm, Thor excused himself from the bar and had the promised “alone time” with me.\n\nThor excuses himself\n\n\n\nThe Second Day\n\nOn the second day, Thor was feeling sick. While we were roaming and chatting, Shaye mentioned that Thor has a “secret wife”. After we went back to Thor’s hotel room I messaged him asking about a wife, which he denied and blamed me for making the situation weird. [Final Conversation [/twitchcon-2018/final-conversation]]\n\nSince Thor refused to talk, I decided to message Shaye about it. I explained my situation to them, and when asked if it was true, I sent screenshots of the conversation where I guided Thor to my hotel room. Shaye was sympathetic, and I would learn that they were also sexual partners, and that they were in an agreement to be open at the con as long as they communicated it with each other. [Recollection of TwitchCon [/sources/recollection-of-twitchcon]]\n\nShaye was devastated, and messaged Thor about his uncommunicated infidelity. Thor blamed me for “sending logs to Shaye”, saying “leave me alone” and “Why that would ever be ok is beyond me”.\n\nI left the room, and Thor blocked me.\n\n\n\n    \n 1. The First Day\n 2.
