Heya! Would it be okay if I made some piano covers of the OST?


[2/15/2018 6:55 AM] lyricwulf
Thank you!

Hey Thor


[3/10/2018 10:42 AM] lyricwulf
Just wanna put this out there, I made an honest mistake. I've published this new video on Baron's theme <https://youtu.be/kiWjZRSVOWI> without thinking about licensing. I know you've told me about licensing before with the Ramul cover but it honestly slipped my mind. I've put a descriptive link to the Heartbound page and I am more than happy to give royalties or anything since I'm not sure if you've gotten your thing with YouTube Content ID sorted out yet. Just wanted to let you know, thanks for reading!

Hmm... I know that some of my songs have split revenue on them based on "composition" and not just the sound


[3/10/2018 12:21 PM] lyricwulf
I believe that you might have to be (or be in contact with) a "content manager" (as in an MCN or similar content managers).


[3/10/2018 12:22 PM] lyricwulf
Using a tool called YouTube CMS (Content management system?)


[3/10/2018 12:22 PM] lyricwulf
mcn is a multi-creator network


[3/10/2018 12:22 PM] lyricwulf
Basically content managers.


[3/10/2018 12:22 PM] lyricwulf
I know that I can contact my network and claim part of a video on my behalf.


[3/10/2018 12:23 PM] lyricwulf
On a case-by-case basis.


[3/10/2018 12:26 PM] lyricwulf
Also I know that if you use Content ID to claim assets you can choose not to monetize (just track analytics) on those videos


[3/10/2018 12:27 PM] lyricwulf
I think you will want to set up that Content ID that they are talking about and just track your assets, because then you should have access to this tool mentioned in this article: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/106984?hl=en&ref_topic=3011554

Manual claiming - YouTube Help
The features described in this article are available only to partners who use YouTube's Content ID matching system.
The Manual claiming tool enables you


[3/10/2018 12:28 PM] lyricwulf
And then if you are just tracking the videos and not monetizing then the other creators should not be impacted negatively.


[3/10/2018 12:30 PM] lyricwulf
lol


[3/10/2018 12:30 PM] lyricwulf
Well, I'm glad to help xD


[3/10/2018 12:31 PM] lyricwulf
Let me know if you have any other questions, and I'll try my best to help ^^


[3/10/2018 12:32 PM] lyricwulf
those videos will be claimed but you have options to not block or monetize them on your behalf

[3/10/2018 12:34 PM] lyricwulf
I get this "usage policy" menu for my own video because i'm part of a network


[3/10/2018 12:34 PM] lyricwulf
I believe you can set the default action.


[3/10/2018 12:34 PM] lyricwulf
lemme read the article again


[3/10/2018 12:35 PM] lyricwulf
Yes you can set a default action.


[3/10/2018 12:35 PM] lyricwulf
`The list shows the policies available in your account, with your default usage policy selected (or Track in all countries if you don’t have a default usage policy). Select a different policy to override the default.`

heeey thor long time no talk


[7/11/2018 4:25 PM] lyricwulf
I was planning on covering another one of the songs from Heartbound, if it's ok with you, I'd like to come to a license agreement with you, if you've got the youtube copyright thing sorted out


[7/11/2018 4:53 PM] lyricwulf
Ah oke


[7/11/2018 4:53 PM] lyricwulf

[8/7/2018 3:40 PM] lyricwulf
I messaged Materia Collective about the cover thing


[8/7/2018 3:41 PM] lyricwulf
they didn't mention anything about youtube content id revenue sharing


[8/7/2018 3:41 PM] lyricwulf
just about sheet music and publishing the track on like spotify


[8/7/2018 3:41 PM] lyricwulf
oH


[8/7/2018 3:42 PM] lyricwulf

[8/7/2018 3:42 PM] lyricwulf
I'm really glad to be a part of this :3


[8/7/2018 3:44 PM] lyricwulf
Also, it's customary for me to release sheet music and stuff free of charge (I'm a strong believer in free music education), would you prefer that I don't do that for heartbound music or is it ok as is?


[8/7/2018 6:51 PM] lyricwulf

Hey Thor, since we talked about raiding and stuff yesterday, I have been wondering if it's gotten annoying because I raid so often xP


[8/14/2018 9:47 AM] lyricwulf

[8/27/2018 6:07 PM] lyricwulf
*blushes as you take charge, letting out a quiet groan as you push into him all the way. As you keep thrusting in and out of him, he hangs his mouth open, letting out the occasional moan and groan as he overflows with pleasure~*

[8/27/2018 6:14 PM] lyricwulf

(*huff...* i never really entertained the thought much though)


[8/27/2018 6:21 PM] lyricwulf
*starts to tense up and his member pulses. He places one paw on yours and other on your side, holding onto you as he tilts his head back. He clearly tries to hold back his moans but a few manage to escape his open maw~*


[8/27/2018 6:33 PM] lyricwulf
*feels your member pulsing in me as you release, squeezing tightly against your member and holding all of you inside of me as I let out a loud moan. He shoots several ropes of wolf seed out from between us, quickly matting our fur~*

well... when i think about someone romantically, i don't really think about the dating part all too much... i like looking ahead to like, waking up to them everyday and just going through all the ups and downs of life, experiencing everything with you

like a future, and not really like an extravagant or fantasy-like future


[8/27/2018 8:50 PM] lyricwulf
