comment: "Uhhhhh no it’s not. For example: I can have zero sexual partners, then I can want a sexual relationship with one person, and that doesn’t make it a commitment. What makes a commitment is, well, committing to it, eg. by promising I won’t have a sexual relationship with anyone else. That's what Thor is trying to push for. He is twisting reality and trying to use that wonky logic to push that idea into Lyric’s mind."
