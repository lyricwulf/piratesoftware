comment: "Clearly establishing boundaries, followed by self-victimization and appeal to logic. Though I do agree it is dangerous healthwise to have multiple partners, it should be noted that <b>Thorâ€™s concerns have been with <i>roleplaying</i> up until this point, and he repeatedly tries to blur the line between roleplaying and physical sex.</b>

While the last part of his message doesn't really make sense in this context (roleplaying), he places this factual statement last as sort of an anchor for his argument. Think about it this way, Lyric cannot argue that it is dangerous to have multiple sexual partners in real life, and if Lyric argues any other point he will call Lyric out for ignoring the \"most important point\""
