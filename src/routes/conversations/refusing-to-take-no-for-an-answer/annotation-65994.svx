comment: "By now, it’s established Jason wants a committed sexual relationship, while Lyric does not want any form of commitment. It is clear that Lyric’s wants and Jason’s wants are incompatible. It would make sense to drop it at this point. However we see <b>Jason is refusing to let Lyric go, still trying to convince Lyric to devote themselves to him. He is not taking no for an answer</b>
<br />

Read the message again. If you think that sounds weird, and that <b>“not boning other peeps”</b> <i>is</i> the commitment of dating, then you are very much not alone. Why would Jason say something so absurd? Well, take into account the power dynamic. Lyric, at age 20 and unsure of their own stance as evidenced in the conversation prior, is in no position to challenge this statement from the older and wiser Jason. <b>This is not the first time Jason says something absurd that reshapes Lyric’s reality.</b>
<br />
<br />
Then, <b>why</b> make this leap in logic? Jason takes this stance because <b>Lyric has been reiterating that they do not want a commitment.</b> It’s phrased so that <b>Jason can get what he wants while convincing Lyric it is also what they want.</b>"
