## Pulling Back

In this conversation, Thor notices that I've been distant. I express my
insecurities about my adequacy.

    Keep in mind at this point in time, **Thor is [married to his wife](/sources/thors-marriage)** and also **has a [committed relationship with Shaye](/twitchcon-2018/meetup)**, and also **lives with both of them**.

<Callout color="yellow" icon="alert">

    Thor will fixate on the fact that Lyric roleplayed with his friend.

    In this conversation, **Thor conflates roleplaying with real-life sex and acuses Lyric of cheating on him**.

    Thor will later **weaponize this admission to impose guilt** on Lyric in [Not Taking No for an Answer: Thor Says Close Friends Aren't Real](/conversations/no-means-yes#3-thor-says-close-friends-arent-real).

</Callout>

## Shaming

Thor shames Lyric for roleplaying, **treating them like filth and accusing them
of cheating on him**.

    For further reading on shame as a tool for abuse, see the article on [Shame](/asides/shame).
