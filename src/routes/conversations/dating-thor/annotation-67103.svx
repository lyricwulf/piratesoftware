Recall that Jason refused to accept any answer other than **“Lyric will devote themselves entirely to Jason”** and forced this discussion for several days until he got Lyric to say what he wanted.

Jason does not give Lyric any alternative to saying this; by repeatedly initiating this discussion, he makes it so that statement is inevitable. Once Lyric agrees with the statement, Jason victimizes himself and frames previous conversations as Lyric’s failures. **Jason makes it Lyric’s burden to prove that they are loyal only to him, even without the label of a relationship.**

It is most likely that this state of a “pending relationship” is deliberately
planned by Jason from the start. In the words of another victim, 

> “He uses not being in a relationship as a reason why he should not allow others to talk about it. Which is controlling. Which is what he says is why he doesn’t want a relationship because he doesn’t want to be controlled.”
