   Note that this is after weeks of manipulation and tearing down Lyric’s defenses.

   **At this point, Thor is able to speak to Lyric without a filter and Lyric
   thinks nothing of it.**

Thor desires for Lyric to have an unhealthy obsession with him. **Sexual obsession, emotional obsession… Thor wants absolute control of Lyric.** In his mind, **Thor needs to correct this as it is the biggest threat to his goals.**

<Callout>

   Thor can speak so plainly about this to Lyric because any “unnecessary”
   resistance from Lyric would lead to more bullying and beratement.

Thor is frustrated at Lyric’s response, not just the message but also Lyric being more hesitant.

Notice his use of sarcasm here: I believe this is actually a defensive trait of his. I believe **he recognizes his comment drove Lyric farther away than he wanted to, and he views it as a blunder.** So, he is playing defensively in this statement, and **now he is trying to convince Lyric why that statement was justified,** eg “You **need** me to say things like that to keep you in check!”.

Thor is frustrated, because **it wasn’t a blunder, until Lyric "misinterpreted"** what Thor was saying.
