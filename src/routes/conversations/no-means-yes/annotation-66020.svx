# comment: This is a line that Thor purposely tries to blur. <b>Recall that he equated roleplaying to “cheating on him”</b>

The message he is referring to:

<Messages from="65246" to="65248" />

The term “recently” is vague and misleading in this context, especially since Thor has no information about when this event actually took place. It’s worth noting that Thor never acknowledged Lyric’s statement or asked about it. **By using the word “recently,” Thor is subtly framing the situation in a way that shifts blame onto Lyric, even though the term is ambiguous and lacks specificity.**

Lyric’s message explicitly specifies that it occurred “before meeting you.” It could mean when Lyric and Thor started messaging each other (February 2018) or when they start being intimate online (August 2018)? Additionally, Lyric was over the age of 18 at the time of the event. **Thor could be referring to “recently” as any time between January 2016 to February 2018—a span of over two years.**
