Thor has demonstrated that some of the items in this list are
exactly what he wants:

- **you loved me**  
- **wanted to live with me**  
- **wanted to be with me forever**

And then there is this item in the list thrown right in the middle

- **you would give me your entire savings**

Doesn’t that seem a little strange? Usually this is not what people fixate on. **“You said that you loved me, that you want to be with me forever, that you would give me all of your money” just seems a little unsettling to me.** Surely this is just speculation…

Let’s explore this for a moment. Thor is referring to a single
[message](https://thor.pc.dev/messages.html#message50017) that Lyric sent:

<Message n="50017" />

It was only mentioned **in conversation** that one time, and Lyric also made numerous donations to Thor. But isn’t it interesting that this is one of the core facets that Thor remembers? 

Why recount this detail specifically? Why not
- Lyric asking for sleep calls? 
- Lyric staying up late even though he has 8am classes? 
- Lyric acting like a pet? 

**There’s something notable about the financial incentive for Thor.**

Not only does it demonstrate quite the selective memory in recounting the past, but also **it’s a description of his ideal version of Lyric**. You will see in these upcoming messages that Thor desperately wants to get down to the bottom of this: **why did Lyric stray from this path?** And more importantly, **what can Thor do now to keep Lyric under his control?**

The specific of this detail never really mattered, since **Thor
was upset at the roleplaying, and he only later attempts to conflate the two. In
this context, it only functions as a tool for blame.**

Even though Lyric said they’d stop, **what Thor wants is obsession
from Lyric, and that means not having an inkling of desire for anyone else**. This confirms:

1. He wants Lyric to be emotionally dependent on him, to the point where **Lyric will have no support group who can help them escape this situation**.

2. He wants Lyric to be sexually dependent on him, to the point where **Lyric has no desire for sexual others whatsoever**.
