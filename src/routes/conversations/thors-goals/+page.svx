   Note that this is after weeks of manipulation and tearing down Lyric’s defenses.

   **At this point, Thor is able to speak to Lyric without a filter and Lyric
   thinks nothing of it.**

## Thor Wants Money

<Callout color="sky">

We already know some of the items in this list are exactly what Thor wants:

- **you loved me**
- **wanted to live with me** (recall that Thor persuades Lyric on this, it’s not Lyric’s own idea.)
- **wanted to be with me forever**

</Callout>

<Callout color="red">

And then there is this item thrown right in the middle

- **you would give me your entire savings**

</Callout>

Doesn’t that seem a little strange? Usually this is not what people fixate on.
**“You said that you loved me, that you want to be with me forever, that you
would give me all of your money”** just seems a little unsettling to me**.**
Surely this is just speculation…

Let’s explore this for a moment.

Thor is referring to a single message that Lyric sent:  
<Message n="50017" />

It was only mentioned **in conversation** that one time, and Lyric also made
numerous donations to Thor. But isn’t it interesting that this is one of the
core facets that Thor remembers?

He remembers that small quip. But why recount this detail specifically? Why not

- Lyric asking for sleep calls?
- Lyric staying up late for Thor, even though they have 8am classes?
- Lyric acting like a pet?

There’s something more here.

<Callout color="red">

  This is selective memory at play. He’s not telling us what happened in the
  past, **he is telling us how he saw Lyric at their best.** **It’s a
  description of his ideal version of Lyric**.

</Callout>

<Callout>

  Not only is that his ideal version of Lyric, he **deserves** to have **that
  Lyric**. Sad hyena tells us that Thor is “hurt” and **sees Lyric as taking
  away that vulnerable and obsessed version of themselves**. You will see in
  these upcoming messages that Thor desperately wants to get down to the bottom
  of this: **why did Lyric stray from this path?** And more importantly, **what
  can Thor do now to keep Lyric under his control?**

</Callout>

## Thor Wants Obsession

<Messages from="66259" to="66273" />

Thor desires for Lyric to have an unhealthy obsession with him. **Sexual obsession, emotional obsession… Thor wants absolute control of Lyric.** In his mind, **Thor needs to correct this as it is the biggest threat to his goals.**

<Callout color="red">

   **Thor can speak plainly about his true goals** to Lyric, because any
   “unnecessary” resistance from Lyric would lead to **more bullying and
   beratement**.

</Callout>

Thor is frustrated at Lyric’s response, not just the message but also Lyric being more hesitant.

Notice his use of sarcasm here: I believe this is actually a defensive trait of his. I believe **he recognizes his comment drove Lyric farther away than he wanted to, and he views it as a blunder.** So, he is playing defensively in this statement, and **now he is trying to convince Lyric why that statement was justified,** eg “You **need** me to say things like that to keep you in check!”.

Thor is frustrated, because **it wasn’t a blunder, until Lyric "misinterpreted"** what Thor was saying.
