Love bombing can be described as **intense displays of affection and
declarations of love early in the relationship**. This rapid progression can be
overwhelming and make it difficult to see potential red flags.

For abusers, love bombing can be the first phase of a cycle of abuse, and is
**often followed by periods of devaluation and [shame](/asides/shame)**. The
abuser may switch from intense affection to criticism, control, and even
emotional abuse.

From the abuser's perspective, **love bombing is an investment**: it is a way to
establish rapport, and can be **later cashed out in the form of compliance,
submission, and control**.

   The primary purpose of this article is to contrast with Thor's demeanor in
   the [Final Conversation](/twitchcon-2018/final-conversation), where he
   attempts to deny any advances toward Lyric:

## Dedication

<Callout color="yellow">

Early on, Thor would establish a pattern of emotional dependence, seeming to
mirror Lyric's desires and emphasize them.

Thor also expects the same dedication from Lyric, conveying his emotional
dependence on them.

## Unconditional Support

<Callout color="red">

Thor would show unconditional support for Lyric. This is a very weird statement
for a 31-year-old to make to a 20-year-old:

## Pet names

Thor would use pet names to establish a sense of intimacy and attachment. He
would also use them to praise Lyric's submission.

<!-- ## Gifts 

While giving gifts is a common practice in relationships, it is also a staple of
the love-bombing and withdrawl cycle. While this action alone does not
constitute manipulation, the pattern it continues is a well-studied manipulative
tactic.

## Training Submission

Thor will often compliment Lyric for their submission, and reward them with
praise for agreeing with him.

## Meeting Up

Thor really looks forward to meeting Lyric, expressing his excitement and even
counting down the days until they meet.

<!-- ## Moving in

Along with [Moving](/conversations/moving), Thor would also try to get Lyric to move in with him, which would further establish his control over Lyric.
