comment: At this point, Thor has an opportunity to completely disengage from romantic relations with Lyric. This question seems to be asked in order <b>to confirm if Lyric can still be brought under Thor’s control</b> even though the last conversation did not end how Thor wanted. <b>Notice how coldly these are asked; this leaves Thor’s opportunities open for both a positive or a negative response.</b>
