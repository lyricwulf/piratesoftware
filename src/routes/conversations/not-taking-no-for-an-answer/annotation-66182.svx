comment: "<b>Thor wants Lyric to change their desires</b>. Thor doesnâ€™t want Lyric to do anything for him, because he needs to maintain dominance. Because of that, <b>there can be no compromise, because in this world, Lyric and Thor are not equals</b>. He wants Lyric to come to the conclusion that they truly want to do it. Not that they are sacrificing something for Thor."
