comment: At this point, Jason has an opportunity to completely disengage from romantic relations with Lyric. This question seems to be asked in order <b>to confirm if Lyric can still be brought under Jason’s control</b> even though the last conversation did not end how Jason wanted. <b>Notice how coldly these are asked; this leaves Jason’s opportunities open for both a positive or a negative response.</b>
