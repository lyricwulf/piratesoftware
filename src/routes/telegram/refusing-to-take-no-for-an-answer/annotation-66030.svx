<b>I believe this could have been a lie.</b> Reading back on our chats, I had previously said “I'm not getting lonely and looking to hook up” before this. Maybe it’s deniable up to this point, but I will consider it 50/50 whether this was a lie or not.

What I do remember is feeling that I was constantly pressured to say things that Jason would like. I can very easily see how I would lie in this situation given that this negative conversation had lasted for hours at this point, this could have easily been an easy out for me."
