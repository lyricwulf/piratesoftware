## Detachment

*\[I have to add some information about this conversation. I messaged Thor first about this, then when he refused to talk about it I talked with Shaye while we were all in the same hotel room.\]*

At TwitchCon, Shaye mentioned that Thor had a “secret wife”.

## Confronting Thor about Wife

| Thor: “As far as I knew we were fooling around and seeing if were comptaible. You've been pushing a lot for a committment kind of thing but I have a lot of work stuff going on and not a lot of time.” |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

This is in contrast to reality, where **in previous conversations I expressed that I was not ready for commitment, and Jason tells me that I must stay committed solely to him to maintain his validation and praise. (source?)**

After I tell him that I heard he has a wife, **he continually disengages with the conversation.**

| Lyric: and a wife apparently Thor: Is there a ring on my finger? lol *\[Mocking, denial, gaslighting: “since I have no ring you must be delusional, overreacting, or misunderstanding”.\]* Lyric: There's not. I just heard about it. That's all Thor: Neat *\[Invalidating Lyric’s feelings, disengagement\]* Lyric: I don't want to jump to conclusions so I just wanted to talk i guess I'm sorry. I don't mean to make it weird Thor: Its a bit weird *\[Shifting blame, mirroring, disengagement.\]* Lyric: It is... I guess I just feel like I'm in an awkward place right now. Thor: Nice, thanks for the giant awkward bomb *\[Shifting blame, mirroring, disengagement. He does this twice in a row.\]* Lyric: I'm sorry |

## After I spoke with Shaye

Compared to just a few minutes past, after he discovers that I shared our conversations with Shaye, **he now feels he can safely re-engage with the conversation now that he can shift the blame by victimizing himself.**

| Thor: Nah dude you're not. Sending logs to Shaye? *\[Deflection of responsibility. Note that Jason has a lot to say about this, but not a lot to say on the above, as shown by his use of mirroring. Jason now feels he can safely re-engage with the conversation now that he can shift the blame.\]* Lyric: what. I don't know what you want Thor: Please leave me alone. *\[Victimizing himself\]* You showed shaye logs of our conversations And now hes talking to me about them. Why that would ever be ok is beyond me *\[Gaslighting: making Lyric question reality, even if there were valid reasons such as seeking clarity\]* Lyric: I have no words for you right now. If you would have just told me what's going on I would have been fine with it Thor: Don't really care dude, nothing is even going on. *\[Gaslighting: dismissing Lyric’s perception of reality\]* Lyric: Look When I showed shaye I had no idea how deep this ran Thor: How deep this ran? lol *\[Mocking, belittlement\]* Definitely not discussing this with you *\[Belittlement, dismissal of Lyric’s concerns\]* |

### Annotated transcript

**Lyric**  
I need to talk with you about something sometime  
Maybe we could sit down and chat soon

**Thor**  
what about?

**Lyric**  
Mmm... The future.

**Thor**  
Whaaaaat about?  
*\[Disregarding boundaries. Jason dictates when and how conversation happens, not allowing Lyric to set the pace.\]*

**Lyric**  
If like  
I'm going to be in your future  
pretty much  
Honestly, I heard that you've got other stuff going on  
I wanted to talk about that I guess...  
I just wanna know what's going on. Not like a conviction sort of way but I'm just a bit confused about our situation.  
*\[Giving an out: providing Jason an opportunity to explain the situation of his other relations\]*

**Thor**  
As far as I knew we were fooling around and seeing if were comptaible. You've been pushing a lot for a committment kind of thing but I have a lot of work stuff going on and not a lot of time.  
*\[Denial, gaslighting: “commitment is your idea, not mine”, making Lyric question reality. Shifting blame to Lyric, deflecting attention from Thor’s own actions.\]*

**Lyric**  
and a wife  
apparently

**Thor**  
Is there a ring on my finger? lol  
*\[Mocking, denial, gaslighting: “since I have no ring you must be delusional, overreacting, or misunderstanding”.\]*

**Lyric**  
There's not.  
I just heard about it.  
That's all

**Thor**  
Neat  
*\[Invalidating Lyric’s feelings, disengagement\]*

**Lyric**  
I don't want to jump to conclusions so I  
just wanted to talk i guess  
I'm sorry. I don't mean to make it weird

**Thor**  
Its a bit weird  
*\[Shifting blame, **mirroring**, disengagement.\]*

**Lyric**  
It is...  
I guess I just feel like I'm in an awkward place right now.

**Thor**  
Nice, thanks for the giant awkward bomb  
*\[Shifting blame, **mirroring**, disengagement. He does this twice in a row.\]*

**Lyric**  
I'm sorry

**Thor**  
Nah dude you're not. Sending logs to Shaye?  
*\[Deflection of responsibility. Note that Jason has a lot to say about this, but not a lot to say on the above, as shown by his use of mirroring. Jason now feels he can safely re-engage with the conversation now that he can shift the blame.\]*

**Lyric**  
what.  
I don't know what you want

**Thor**  
Please leave me alone.  
*\[Victimizing himself\]*  
You showed shaye logs of our conversations  
And now hes talking to me about them.  
Why that would ever be ok is beyond me  
*\[Gaslighting: making Lyric question reality, even if there were valid reasons such as seeking clarity\]*

**Lyric**  
I have no words for you right now.  
If you would have just told me what's going on  
I would have been fine with it

**Thor**  
Don't really care dude, nothing is even going on.  
*\[Gaslighting: dismissing Lyric’s perception of reality\]*

**Lyric**  
Look  
When I showed shaye I had no idea how deep this ran

**Thor**  
How deep this ran? lol  
*\[Mocking, belittlement\]*  
Definitely not discussing this with you  
*\[Belittlement, dismissal of Lyric’s concerns\]*

**Lyric**  
I'm sorry  
I feel used.  
That's it  
And you wouldn't talk to me about it  
Even though you're self declared super straightforward
